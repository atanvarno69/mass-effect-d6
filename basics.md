# Basics

## Rolling Dice

A **die code** shows how good a character is in a particular area, how harmful a weapon is, how useful a talent or tool
is, and so on. Each die code indicates the number of six-sided dice you roll (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, etc.), and sometimes
an added amount of “+1” or “+2” -- referred to as pips -- you add to the total result you roll on the dice.

An species characteristic, talent, or piece of equipment may provide a bonus to the roll. If the bonus is in the form of
a die code (such as +1D), then you add the listed number of regular dice to the amount you would roll. If the bonus is
in the form of a number (such as +2), then you add the amount to the total that you rolled on the dice.

### Wild Die

Whenever any player, including the GM, makes any roll, one of the dice must be different from the rest (in size or
color). Designated as the **wild die**, this odd die represents the vagaries of life -- like the direction of the wind
affecting the ﬂight of a bullet -- that are too small to warrant their own diﬃculty modifiers.

If the player has only 1D to roll, then that one die is always the wild die.

If the player rolls a 6 on the wild die, this is called a **critical success** and they may add the 6 to her total and
roll the wild die again. As long as they turn up critical successes on that die, they may continue to add them to their
total and continue to roll. If they roll anything other than a 6, they add that number to the total and stop rolling.

If the player rolls a 1 on the initial toss of the wild die, this is called a **critical failure**, and the GM may chose
one of two options for the result, depending on the gravity of the situation.

1. The Critical Failure cancels out the highest roll. Then the player adds the remaining values, and the roll is
   determined normally.
2. Add the dice results normally, but a complication occurs. The GM gauges the significance of the complication by the
   total generated -- from a funny, "nearly didn’t do it" result for a high total to a serious, "we have a problem"
   obstacle for a low total.

When using the second option, make certain the complication chosen relates to the task attempted. It should serve as an
extra, minor obstacle the characters must now deal with or, more often, as a place to insert a bit of comic relief. Only
on rare occasions (such as numerous poor decisions by the players) should a complication be without solutions or even
deadly. The complications can also serve as opportunities to bring nearly invincible characters down to a more
reasonable level.

> If a player rolls a critical failure when shooting a ranged weapons, the weapon overheats, for more information see
> the [Equipment](equipment.md) chapter.

**Note:** Unlike rolling a critical failure initially on the wild die, no complications occur when a 1 shows up on later
tosses of the wild die in the same roll.

## Using Skills

At those times when there's a chance that a character may fail at an action, that character must make a **skill check**.
The player decides what they want their character to do and which skill is best for accomplishing the task (sometimes
with the help of the GM). The GM determines a suitable difficulty number, which the player must meet or beat by rolling
the number of dice in the skill and adding the results.

In some cases, a test of one's skills or attributes doesn't involve luck. Just as you wouldn’t make a height check to
see who make a height check to see who is taller, you don't make a *Strength* check to see who is stronger. When two
characters arm wrestle, for example, the stronger character simply wins. In the case of identical scores, then make
opposed *Strength* checks.

**Taking 10:** When a character has time, is not rushed and has at least 3D on a governing attribute assigned to the
skill they are checking, they may instead of rolling take 10 plus their number of skill points as their result.

### Untrained Skill Use

If a character doesn't have skill points in the skill required to attempt an action, they may generally use the die code
of the attribute under which that skill falls. This is sometimes referred to as defaulting to the attribute or using the
skill untrained or unskilled. The GM may include an unskilled modifier to the difficulty. This modifier takes into
account that people who aren't trained or don't have experience in certain tasks usually have a harder time doing them.
Typically, this modifier is +5, but it could be as low as +1 for simple tasks or much higher for complex plans. The GM
may rule that some situations, such as building a spaceship or performing brain surgery, are impossible for anyone to
attempt without the proper training and the correct skills.

## Rounds and Initiative

Generally, time in a roleplaying game doesn't matter too much. A character may spend several hours searching a library,
though only a minute passes as far as the players and GM are concerned. To keep the story moving, sometimes it's
necessary to skip the tedious parts.

More intense scenes require more detail. In these cases, time slows to units of five seconds called **rounds**. Each
character may take one action in the round with no penalty. Unless the character has special skills or abilities,
additional actions increase the difficulty of performing each task (this concept is dealt with later, in the "Multiple
Actions" section). Once a round ends, the next one begins, continuing until the scene ends (with the task completed, the
opponent subdued, and so on).

Since all characters in a scene are making actions in the same five-second round, the actual length of game time taken
up by an action is usually less than five seconds. This is obviously the case when a single character is performing
multiple actions, but it is also true when one character reacts to what another character is doing. Actions in rounds
are not simultaneous (actions out of rounds sometimes are).

Once rounds have been characters act in order of their *Initiative* derived stat.

### Initiative Ties

In the event of ties, comparing characteristics can decide the order of actions. The character with the highest value in
the characteristic goes first, and so on. Once a character has a spot in the order, it doesn't change, regardless of how
other characteristics compare. Ties are broken by moving to the next factor and looking at those values. The order:

1. player characters go before non-player characters
2. characteristic or talent that allows the character to go first
3. special equipment or situation that allows the character to go before another character
4. *dodge* skill points

### Performing Actions in Rounds

A character does not need to declare what they intend to do until their turn comes up in the round. Once the character
decides to take their turn, they may use as many actions as they want, but the player must determine the **multi action
penalty** for the total number of actions that the character wishes to take in that round. The character does not need
to declare when figuring the multi action penalty what they intend to do with all of their actions.

**Note:** waiting counts as an action (once per each time the character wishes to wait).

The character may take no additional actions once the multi action penalty is figured. Any actions calculated into the
multi action penalty but that the character did not use by the end of the round are lost.

A character may take a few actions, wait, take a few more, wait again, and so on, as long as the player has declared a
sufficient number of actions in which to do everything they want their character to do (including waiting).

A character may only interrupt another character's action if they have waited and after that character has made the
skill check and spent any points, but before the GM declares the result.

Only a few instances exist in which the GM may permit a character to "move up" their turn and react to another
character's actions. These include catching a thrown object, resisting certain mental attempts, and other situations
that the GM deems appropriate. These do take the character's action, though the player can declare that their character
will perform multiple actions in the round. For the most part, having a turn later in the round than another's simply
means that another character could take advantage of the situation faster.

### Multiple Actions

Characters may attempt to perform several tasks in a single round, or, if the action takes longer than one round to
complete, in the same minimum time period. The more they try to do, however, the less care and concentration they can
apply to each action. It becomes more difficult to succeed at all of the tasks. Thus, for most characters, for each
action taken beyond the first, the player must subtract 1D from all skill or attribute rolls.

Thus, trying to do four actions in one round gives the character a -3D modifier to each roll.

Only equipment and weapons suited for quick multiple actions may be used several times (up to the limit of their
capabilities) in a round.

A character may not rely on any skill or attribute reduced to zero.

### Free Actions

Free actions are anything a character can automatically perform except under the most extreme conditions. They don't
require a skill roll or much effort. If the GM thinks a task requires concentration (and has a possibility of failure,
thus requiring a skill roll), it's not a free action.

* speaking a few words to someone nearby
* a quick glance around a room (and possibly a *Perception* check)
* moving half or less of the character's Move over an easy area or up to a meter over more challenging terrain

Additionally, the following player actions do not count as character actions:

* rolling to resist damage or effects
* rolling *willpower* or *Knowledge* to determine the emotional effects of the environment on the character

## Preparing

A character willing to spend twice as much time to complete a task receives a +1D bonus for the check for every doubling
of time, up to a maximum bonus of +3D. However, the character can do nothing else or be otherwise distracted (such as
getting shot at) during this time.

## Rushing

A character can also attempt to perform an action that normally requires two or more rounds (10 seconds or more) in less
time. The difficulty increases depending on how much less time the character puts into the task: +5 for 25% less time,
+10 for 50% less time, and +20 for 75% less time. A character may not perform any task in less than 25% of the normally
needed time. Thus, to rush an hour-long surgery into 30 minutes, the diﬃculty increases by +10.

Not every task can be rushed. If in doubt, the GM should ask the player to justify how the character can speed up the
task.

## Groups

To save time, the GM may chose to roll one action for a group of characters they control. Any number can belong to the
group. Each member of the group does not have to perform exactly the same maneuver, but they do need to take similar
actions.

## Choosing Difficulties

There are two possibilities for assigning diﬃculties to a speciﬁc action: a diﬃculty number or an opposed roll. Certain
circumstances (typically involving a character attempting a task without a force actively opposing them, such as
climbing a wall or piloting a ship) may call for a static diﬃculty number. In these cases, select a **standard
difficulty** or use a special diﬃculty. Circumstances involving an actively opposing force call for an **opposed
difficulty**.

### Standard Difficulties

A **standard difficulty** is a number that the GM assigns to an action based on how challenging the GM thinks it is.
Existing conditions can change the difficulty of an action. For instance, walking has an Automatic difficulty for most
characters, but the GM may require someone who is just regaining the use of his legs to make a Very Difficult *stamina*
check to move even a few steps.

| Standard Difficulty | Difficulty Number |
| :------------------ | :---------------- |
| Automatic           | 0                 |
| Very Easy           | 1-5               |
| Easy                | 6-10              |
| Moderate            | 11-15             |
| Difficult           | 16-20             |
| Very Difficult      | 21-30             |
| Heroic              | 31-40             |
| Legendary           | > 40              |

### Opposed Difficulties

An **opposed difficulty** (also called an opposed roll) applies when one character resists another character's action.
In this case, both characters roll and compare totals . The character with the higher value wins, and ties go to the
initiator of the action.

In an opposed task, since both characters are actively doing something, both the initiator and the resisting character
use up actions. This means that the resisting character can only participate in an opposed task either if they waited
for the initiating character to make a move or if they were actively preparing for the attempt. Otherwise, the GM may
allow a reaction roll of the appropriate skill as a free action in some circumstances.

### Generic Modifiers
The modifiers oﬀered in a skill's entry may not cover all the GM's needs. When conditions arise for which there aren't
pre-established modifiers, use this chart to help. GMs can add these modifiers to opposed, standard, or derived
difficulty values.

| Situational Example                                                                            | Difficulty Modifier |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Overwhelming disadvantage: Something affects the skill use in an almost crippling fashion (repairing a vehicle without any proper tools) | ≥ +16 |
| Decisive disadvantage: The skill use is very limited by circumstance (trying to find someone in complete darkness) | +11–15 |
| Signiﬁcant disadvantage: The skill use is aﬀected negatively (tracking someone through drizzling rain) | +6–10 |
| Slight disadvantage: There is an annoying problem (picking a lock by flashlight) | +1–5 |
| Slight advantage: A tool or modification that makes the skill use a little easier (small spikes on shoes for *climbing/jumping*) | -1–5 |
| Significant advantage: A tool or modiﬁcation that makes the skill use much easier (rope with knots is used for *climbing/jumping*) | -6–10 |
| Decisive advantage: A tool specifically designed to make the job easier (complete language database used for languages) | -11–15 |
| Overwhelming advantage: An exceptional tool or modiﬁcation that specifically makes the skill use much easier (wilderness tools and equipment specially designed to help with survival) | ≥ -16 |

### Determining Success

If the total rolled on the dice is greater than the difficulty, the attempt was a success. Ties generally go to the
initiator of the action, but certain circumstances dictate otherwise (such as the use of some talents or determining the
amount of damage done). The description of the ability, challenge, or activity explains the results.

### Failed Checks

If you fail a skill or an attribute check, you may retry the roll if your GM allows it. Simply add the difference
between the set difficulty and your failed roll and add it to the new difficulty level.

> **Example:** If you were rolling for 16 but you rolled 10, add 6 to the difficulty of your next skill check.

The GM may always decide that this penalty for failing a task at the first try is unnecessary and let the player roll
again with the same difficulty. That should depend on the intensity of the situation in which the characters find
themselves in.

## Moving

Your character's **move** stat (usually 10) represents how many meters you can move in a round at maximum walking speed
in standard gravity. Moving at cautious speed you move at a half of your move stat. Running is at the double of your
move stat and sprinting is at four times of your move stat. Moving is a free action with the exception of sprinting.
While all actions when you move at cautious and normal speed are at normal difficulty, the actions that you take while
running are at +6 to difficulty. Also moving in difficult terrain or for long distances may require an *acrobatics* or
*stamina* check.

## Using Ranged Combat Skills

*Dexterity* has several **ranged combat skills** covering weapons that can be used to attack someone from a distance.
These skills all work the same way. When a character shoots a ranged weapon, the difficulty number is based on the
**Defense** value of the target or the distance when shooting objects: the further away a target, the higher the
difficulty number. If your skill roll is equal to or greater than the difficulty number, your attack hits. It's not
always that simple, sometimes the target is behind a cover or makes a full dodge so the GM has to alter the difficulty
accordingly.

**Mechanical** also has ranged combat skills covering spaceship weapons.

## Using Close Combat Skills

*Melee* covers any type of melee weapons and *brawling* coves any type of hand-to-hand attacks. When attacking an
opponent the character has to roll equal to or higher than the Defense value of the target to hit. When attacking with
weapons it's the **Melee Defense** value and when attacking with bare hands (or claws) it's the **Brawling Defense**
value. In close combat the targets using *melee* may parry if they have any actions left in that round. In that case the
parrying character has to roll one point above the attacker's roll to parry. If successful no damage is dealt.

## Actions Per Round & Initiative

At the beginning of the round every player declares how many actions he will be attempting during that particular round.
When a player declares more than one action, they incur the **multi-action penalty**, a negative modifier of -1D per
additional action to all actions attempted during that round. The player with the lowest initiative declares first and
the player with the highest initiative declares last. After all actions have been declared the player with the highest
initiative starts the round. Making their first action followed by the first action of the second character and so on.

> **Optional Rule:** If you want and have the time for it you can check the number of your actions against you
> initiative score (dividing the initiative by the number of your actions), that way sometimes a player with high enough
> initiative may attempt more than one action before other players and opponents.

**Full reaction:** a character adds +10 to their appropriate Defense value. However, a character making a full reaction
can't do anything else in that round.

## Hit Points

| Wound Level      | Hit Points Remaining | Check Modifier     |
| :--------------- | :------------------- | :----------------- |
| Lightly Wounded  | 99%-66%              | -1D                |
| Wounded          | 65%-33%              | -3D                |
| Severely Wounded | 32%-1%               | -5D                |
| Almost Dead      | 0                    | Can't take actions |
| Dead             | < 0                  | Can't take actions |

## Paragon & Renegade Points

**Paragon** and **Renegade** points are awarded for being brutal or gentle in various situations, or being selfish or
selfless. If you're playing a morally good person who helps the locals fight off a Geth attack for no reward or personal
gain, you could be awarded with a Paragon point for your efforts. If your character is greedy and selfish and demands
payment after saving the locals, you could be given a Renegade point by the GM. Paragon and Renegade points, besides
showing the nature of the individual, grant a mechanical bonus.

Paragon and Renegade points may be spent for one of:

* +5D to a *con*, *persuasion*, *command* or *intimidation* check.
* +3 bonus to any roll's result.

Only one Paragon or Renegade point may be spent per roll.

## Medals

**Medals** are awarded for completing challenging tasks or mission objectives. It is up to the GM to figure out how
many, if any, will be given at the end of an adventure or campaign. Medals are what separates your characters from
ordinary people making them great heroes or feared villains. Only player characters may have medals.

Medals may be spent for one of:

* +3D to any check
* healing 10 hit points
