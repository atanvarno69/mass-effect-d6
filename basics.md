# Basics

## Skill, Attribute Checks & Difficulties

When you want to do something that may present a challenge (according to your GM), you roll an appropriate skill check
to see if you succeed. When you use a skill, roll the dice code and compare against a difficulty number. The number is
set by your GM and can go from 1 (very easy) to 30 or more (heroic). Most of the skill checks will be within those
boundaries but not all. Many combat, hack, speech or talent checks may be against much larger difficulty numbers.

| Difficulty     | Difficulty Number |
| :------------- | :---------------- |
| Very Easy      | 1-5               |
| Easy           | 6-10              |
| Moderate       | 11-15             |
| Difficult      | 16-20             |
| Very Difficult | 21-30             |
| Heroic         | > 30              |

Sometimes you try to do something to which no specific skill applies. In those cases, you make an attribute check: Roll
the attribute's dice code instead of a skill's.

The GM assigns a difficulty or sets up an opposed check when two characters are engaged in a contest using one skill or
attribute against another.

In some cases, a test of one's skills or attributes doesn't involve luck. Just as you wouldnâ€™t make a height check to
see who make a height check to see who is taller, you don't make a *Strength* check to see who is stronger. When two
characters arm wrestle, for example, the stronger character simply wins. In the case of identical scores, then make
opposed *Strength* checks.

**Taking 10:** When a character has time, is not rushed and has at least 3D on a governing attribute assigned to the
skill they are checking, they may instead of rolling take 10 plus their number of skill points as their result.

## Skill Descriptions

**Time:** How much time it takes to make a check with this skill, if that information hasn't already been covered
elsewhere.

**Description:** The skill description tells you what the skill covers and gives a few sample difficulties and
modifiers.

**Specializations:** Possible examples of specializations.

**Special:** Any special rules that apply.

**Note:** Things you should be mindful of when using a particular skill.

## How long does it take?

Firing a ranged weapon takes only a split second, but programming a mech or fixing a starship can take hours, sometimes
days. So how do you figure out how long it takes to do something? Some skills may only take a round, but require such
concentration that the character can do nothing else in the round -- first aid, computer use or driving a rover are good
examples. Several skills list a range of times, such as "one round to five minutes" or "one round to two hours". GM must
estimate how long it takes to complete the task.

## Failed Checks

If you fail a skill or an attribute check, you may retry the roll if your GM allows it. Simply add the difference
between the set difficulty and your failed roll and add it to the new difficulty level.

> **Example:** If you were rolling for 16 but you rolled 10, add 6 to the difficulty of your next skill check.

The GM may always decide that this penalty for failing a task at the first try is unnecessary and let the player roll
again with the same difficulty. That should depend on the intensity of the situation in which the characters find
themselves in.

## Wild Die

Whenever you or your GM makes any roll, one of the dice must be different from the rest (in size or color). Designated
as the **wild die**, this odd die represents the vagaries of life (like the direction of the wind affecting the flight
of a bullet) that are too small to warrant their own difficulty modifiers.

If you roll a 6 on the wild die, it is a **critical success** and you may add the 6 to your total and roll the wild die
again. As long as you roll critical successes on that die, you may continue to add them to your total and continue to
roll. If you roll anything other than a 6, you add that number to the total and stop rolling.

If you roll a 1 on the initial roll of the wild die, this is a **critical failure**. The critical failure cancels out
the highest roll. Then you add the remaining values, and the result is otherwise determined normally, but the may decide
that a complication occurs. The GM gauges the significance of the complication by the total generated from a funny,
"nearly didn't do it" result for a high total to a serious, "we have a problem" obstacle for a low total.

When you roll a critical failure when shooting range weapons they overheat, for more information see the
[Equipment](equipment.md) chapter.

## Moving

Your character's **move** stat (usually 10) represents how many meters you can move in a round at maximum walking speed
in standard gravity. Moving at cautious speed you move at a half of your move stat. Running is at the double of your
move stat and sprinting is at four times of your move stat. Moving is a free action with the exception of sprinting.
While all actions when you move at cautious and normal speed are at normal difficulty, the actions that you take while
running are at +6 to difficulty. Also moving in difficult terrain or for long distances may require an *acrobatics* or
*stamina* check.

## Using Ranged Combat Skills

*Dexterity* has several **ranged combat skills** covering weapons that can be used to attack someone from a distance.
These skills all work the same way. When a character shoots a ranged weapon, the difficulty number is based on the
**Defense** value of the target or the distance when shooting objects: the further away a target, the higher the
difficulty number. If your skill roll is equal to or greater than the difficulty number, your attack hits. It's not
always that simple, sometimes the target is behind a cover or makes a full dodge so the GM has to alter the difficulty
accordingly.

**Mechanical** also has ranged combat skills covering spaceship weapons.

## Using Close Combat Skills

*Melee* covers any type of melee weapons and *brawling* coves any type of hand-to-hand attacks. When attacking an
opponent the character has to roll equal to or higher than the Defense value of the target to hit. When attacking with
weapons it's the **Melee Defense** value and when attacking with bare hands (or claws) it's the **Brawling Defense**
value. In close combat the targets using *melee* may parry if they have any actions left in that round. In that case the
parrying character has to roll one point above the attacker's roll to parry. If successful no damage is dealt.

## Actions Per Round & Initiative

At the beginning of the round every player declares how many actions he will be attempting during that particular round.
When a player declares more than one action, they incur the **multi-action penalty**, a negative modifier of -1D per
additional action to all actions attempted during that round. The player with the lowest initiative declares first and
the player with the highest initiative declares last. After all actions have been declared the player with the highest
initiative starts the round. Making their first action followed by the first action of the second character and so on.

> **Optional Rule:** If you want and have the time for it you can check the number of your actions against you
> initiative score (dividing the initiative by the number of your actions), that way sometimes a player with high enough
> initiative may attempt more than one action before other players and opponents.

**Full reaction:** a character adds +10 to their appropriate Defense value. However, a character making a full reaction
can't do anything else in that round.

## Hit Points

| Wound Level      | Hit Points Remaining | Check Modifier     |
| :--------------- | :------------------- | :----------------- |
| Lightly Wounded  | 99%-66%              | -1D                |
| Wounded          | 65%-33%              | -3D                |
| Severely Wounded | 32%-1%               | -5D                |
| Almost Dead      | 0                    | Can't take actions |
| Dead             | < 0                  | Can't take actions |

## Paragon & Renegade Points

**Paragon** and **Renegade** points are awarded for being brutal or gentle in various situations, or being selfish or
selfless. If you're playing a morally good person who helps the locals fight off a Geth attack for no reward or personal
gain, you could be awarded with a Paragon point for your efforts. If your character is greedy and selfish and demands
payment after saving the locals, you could be given a Renegade point by the GM. Paragon and Renegade points, besides
showing the nature of the individual, grant a mechanical bonus.

Paragon and Renegade points may be spent for one of:

* +5D to a *con*, *persuasion*, *command* or *intimidation* check.
* +3 bonus to any roll's result.

Only one Paragon or Renegade point may be spent per roll.

## Medals

**Medals** are awarded for completing challenging tasks or mission objectives. It is up to the GM to figure out how
many, if any, will be given at the end of an adventure or campaign. Medals are what separates your characters from
ordinary people making them great heroes or feared villains. Only player characters may have medals.

Medals may be spent for one of:

* +3D to any check
* healing 10 hit points
