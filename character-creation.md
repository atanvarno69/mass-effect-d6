# Character Creation

## 1 Character Concept

Choose a **species**, name, look and background for your character. Talk with your GM about the character to make it
more plausible and in tune with the Mass Effect experience they have prepared.

## 2 Distribute Attribute Dice

There are six main **attributes**. Each species has a different amount of **attribute dice** to distribute. Assign your
attribute dice so that your species' minimum value is met and its maximum value is not exceeded for each attribute.

### Biotic

The **Biotic attribute** is optional and you may choose not to assign attribute dice to it.

If you want to have a biotic character, assign attribute dice to the Biotic attribute in addition to the six main
attributes. You will also need to install a Biotic Implant and optionally the Wetwire Port if you wish to use biotic
amps later in the game. When installing any cybernetics, remember to mark how many upgrade points you’ve used up (you
may use up to 30 upgrade points before the danger of becoming a synthetic). Check
[Cybernetics and Cloning](cybernetics-and-cloning.md) for more information and rules on biotic implants.

Players wishing to play Biotic character have to ask GM for permission since it may drastically alter the balance of a
group.

## 3 Distribute Skill Points

Under each attribute are several **skills**. Assign 21 **skill points** to skills. You may assign a maximum of 6 skill
points to any single skill. Each skill point assigned will grant +1 to checks using that skill.

Under each attribute, the maximum number of skills which can be assigned skill points is equal to the attribute dice
code plus your Knowledge attribute dice code.

> Example: Your Dexterity is 3D+1 and your Knowledge is 2D+2. You can assign skill points to up to 6 skills under
> Dexterity (3D+1 and 2D+2 is 6D in total). And you can assign skill points to up to 5 skills under Knowledge (2D+2 and
> 2D+2 is 5D+1).

### Optional: Specializations

You may pick up to two skill **specializations**.

1 skill point equals 2 **specialization skill points**.

You don’t need to have any extra skill points in the base skill in order to take a specialization in that skill, but
when you give your character specializations in that manner, they are treated as separate skills.

You can only specialize in skills which you have chosen during character creation and your character may have a maximum
of two specializations.

Each specialization may start with a maximum of 9 specialization skill points assigned to it.

### Optional: Advanced Skills

You may choose **advanced skills**. Those skills require a specific basic skill with at least 6 skill points assigned in
order to be taken.

If there is an "(A)" listed with the skill name on the skill list it's an advanced skill.

## 4 Species Characteristics & Derived Stats

**Species characteristics** are unusual talents and abilities that you get, those are defined by the species you choose
to play. These may alter the character creation rules presented here, or provide modifiers or other effects in game.

The **derived stats** are very important and are influenced by your attributes, skills and unique race abilities. Round
down all multiplications and divisions to an integer value.

### Move

Your **move** is the number of meters your character can move in a round at a normal pace. You start with the minimum
move value listed for your species. Each additional meter of move (up to your species' maximum) costs 1D of attribute
dice.

### Ranged Defense

**Ranged defense** = 3 × Dexterity dice + Dexterity pips + Dodge skill points

### Melee Defense

**Melee defense** = 3 × Strength dice + Strength pips + Melee skill points

### Brawling Defense

**Brawling defense** = 3 × Strength dice + Strength pips + Brawling skill points

### Vehicle Defense

**Vehicle defense** = 3 × Mechanical dice + Mechanical pips + Rover Operation skill points

### Starship Defense

**Starship defense** = 3 × Mechanical dice + Mechanical pips + Pilot skill points

### Damage Resistance

**Damage resistance** = Strength dice + armor + bonuses from talents

### Brawling/Melee Damage

**Brawling/melee Damage** = Strength + Lift ÷ 2

### Initiative

**Initiative** = 3 × Perception dice + Perception pips + Dexterity dice + Search skill points ÷ 6 + Tactics skill points ÷ 6

### Hit Points

**Hit points** = 3 × Strength dice + Strength pips + 20

### Credits

**Credits** = (Knowledge dice ÷ 4 + Business skill points ÷ 3 + Gambling skill points ÷ 3 + Value skill points ÷ 3)D × 250

## 5 Talents

The talents you get at character creation are at rank 0.

### Biotic Talents

You may take a number of biotic powers less than or equal to the number of your Biotic attribute dice. You must meet the
prerequisites of any biotic powers you take.

1 skill point can be spent for +1 in a biotic talent.

### Combat & Tech Talents

You may take any Power you have the prerequisites for.

## 6 Paragon & Renegade Points

Choose either:

* 4 Paragon points
* 4 Renegade points
* 2 Paragon points and 2 Renegade points

## 7 Choose Equipment

Spend credits to purchase your starting equipment.

The GM may allow additional equipment after consulting the player.

## 8 Assign Medals

Every character starts with 3 medals.
