# Character Advancement

**Character points** can be spent to advance characters between adventures.

## Improving Skills and Attributes

The character needs experience with the skill or attribute, either through training or by attempting to use it (through
rolling its die code, regardless of the outcome) during an adventure in order to improve it.

If the GM decides that there is a significant amount of training involved (such as improving a skill beyond +10), or the
character needs to find a suitable teacher, that might become an adventure’s focus.

### Learning New Skills

A new skill costs 5 − governing attribute dice character points (minimum of 1).

### Improving Skills

1 skill point = (current skill points + 1) character points.

### Learning New Specializations

A new specialization costs 1 character point.

### Improving Specializations

1 specialization skill point = ((current specialization skill points + 1) ÷ 2) character points (rounded up).

### Learning New Advanced Skills

A new skill costs (5 − governing attribute dice) × 2 character points (minimum of 2).

### Improving Advanced Skills

1 skill point = (current skill points + 1) × 2 character points.

### Learning New Talents

A new talent costs 5 character points.

### Improving Talents

You can only advance biotic talents; Tech and Combat Talents are skill based.

Biotic talents cost the same as skills to improve.

### Improving Attributes

1 attribute point = current attribute dice × 10 character points.

/* This seems like bullshit? */

Every time an adult character improves a Dexterity, Strength, Perception, Mechanical, Knowledge and Technical attribute,
the player rolls that attribute’s new die code and the GM rolls one die less than the maximum die code for the species,
including any appropriate Special Abilities. If the GM’s roll equals or exceeds the player’s roll, the attribute
improves. If it does not, the attribute does not improve, the character gets half the character points back, and the
character has reached her upper limit for that attribute.
