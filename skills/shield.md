## *Shield* (*Strength*)

*Shield* is a combat skill and allows the player to use heavy combat shields. Normally the combat shields are used by
high profile military and mercenary personnel. The shield in itself is a high density polymer that absorbs vast amounts
of damage, but is also very heavy. That's why only people wearing a Medium or Heavy armor with Exoskeleton or Crusher
Mods can operate this kind of defense equipment.

When a character uses the shield, their *Brawling defense*, *Melee defense* and *Ranged defense* values are raised by
their *Shield* skill points.
