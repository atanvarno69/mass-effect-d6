# *Value* (*Knowledge*)

*Value* reflects a character's ability to gauge the fair market value of goods based on the local economy. The character
can also gauge specific capabilities of and modifications made to goods with regard to performance. Using value often
answers the question, "How much is it really worth?". Results often depend on the information the character already
knows about that kind of merchandise. A starship dealer rattling on about a particular used-freighter might be
exaggerating -- although characters can make some estimation based on the starship model. If the item can be examined in
person, its value is much easier to determine.
