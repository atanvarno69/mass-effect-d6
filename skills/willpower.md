# *Willpower* (*Knowledge*)

*Willpower* is generally used to resist interaction attempts and mentally damaging attacks. Characters with this skill
may generally use it instead of *stamina* to resist fatigue, sleep, and unconsciousness, though there may be some
situations the GM restricts its substitution.

The GM can also use *willpower* (or *Knowledge*) to determine the reactions of characters to each other and to their
surroundings. The more the GM believes that the character should be at ease or frightened, the greater the difficulty.
Use the descriptions of standard difficulties to determine the level.
