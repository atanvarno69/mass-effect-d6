# *Gambling* (*Perception*)

*Gambling* is winning and cheating at games of strategy and luck.

*Gambling* doesn't affect games that are purely random, but does influence games with an element of strategy, like
poker. All characters make opposed *gambling* checks, without spending Character Points, and the highest roll wins. A
character may cheat by using Character Points on the check. The GM should consider as many "angles" as possible when
using the *gambling* skill, and add these as modifiers to one or more participants' rolls.
