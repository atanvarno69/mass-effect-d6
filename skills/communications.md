# *Communications* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** 1 round

**Specializations:** Type or model of communications unit — comlink, subspace radio

*Communications* represents a character's ability to use radios, comlinks and other communications systems. While
operating communication devices is normally a Very Easy task, the difficulty numbers are higher when the skill is used
to descramble enemy codes and find enemy transmission frequencies. Characters may also use communications to send or
receive a signal through natural hazards which disrupt communications, such as a gas cloud, heavy magnetic fields or
locations with a high metal content.

The following difficulties are for finding a specific kind of frequency:

| Frequency                                                                                           | Difficulty     |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| Listening in on a known, registered frequency; Public communications, low-security corporate networks | Very Easy    |
| Listening in on a specific private frequency; Low security government communications like emergency services | Easy  |
| Listening in on a somewhat sensitive communication frequency; Local governments, sensitive businesses or security-conscious individuals | Moderate |
| Tapping professionally secure channels; Mercenary or higher-level police bands                      | Difficult      |
| Listening in on military, or high-ranking government channels                                       | Very Difficult |
| Listening in on a top-secret Specter, Citadel or Cerberus frequency                                 | Heroic         |

If the signal is coded, the character can use *communications* check to decode the message. Some broadcasting devices
have coding die codes, which adds to the broadcaster's *communication* skills when determining how difficult it is to
decode the message. By comparing the results on the table below the character may decode none, some or all of the
message.

| Decoder's Result | Decoder learns                                      |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| ≤ −6             | Nothing can be made out                             |
| −1-5             | Decoder makes out wrong message                     |
| 0-3              | One or two garbled passages                         |
| 4-6              | About one-quarter of the information in the message |
| 7-10             | About half of the information in the message        |
| ≥ 11             | The entire message is unscrambled                   |
