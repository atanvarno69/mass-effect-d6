# *Sensors* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** 1 round or longer

**Specializations:** Type or model scanner — hand scanner, med diagnostic scanner, heat sensor

This is an [observation skill](observation-skills.md).

*Sensors* covers operating various kinds of sensors, including those that detect life forms, identifing vehicles,
picking up energy readings, and make long-distance visual readings. *Sensors* covers everything from portable hand
scanners to the huge sensor arrays used on capital ships and in military bases.

**Note:** *Sensors* may be used as a plot devices: the characters should detect just enough to intrigue them. They'll
have to personally investigate the situation to find out the whole story.

While there are plenty of sensors modifiers to choose from, don't be afraid to keep things simple! Pick a difficulty
number using your judgement. If the character beats the difficulty number, they detect something; if they roll really
well, they will be able to get very detailed information. One *sensors* check can be made per round: the character
detects everything they rolled well enough to notice.

*Sensors* can perform two distinct tasks: detection and identification:

**Active mode** is when a sensor detects something, it means that it has noticed the object. The sensors can detect
specific parts of a ship but cannot give you any more information on their function, for that you use passive mode.

**Passive mode** is when a sensor identifies something, it means that the sensor can identify specific things like
temperature, life forms, radio waves or heat.

| Passive Mode Sensors                                               | Modifier                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Target is using a sensor decoy, sensors detect both ship and decoy | +5 difficulty                        |
| Target ship is running silent (See [Space](space.md))              | +15 or more difficulty               |
| Ship is hiding behind planet or other massive body                 | +10 or more difficulty               |
| Ship has other mass objects, such as asteroids, to hide among      | +20 difficulty                       |
| Targeting a small natural body; a small asteroid                   | +1D+2 to the character's roll        |
| Target is the size of a capital ship or a decent-sized asteroid    | +3D+1 to the character's roll        |
| Planetary or moon-sized natural body like the Citadel              | +6D+2 to the character's roll        |
| Stellar object; a star, nebula, black hole                         | +10D or more to the character's roll |

If the sensor operator scans a ship with passive scanners and beats the *sensors* difficulty by 10 or more points, they
can pick out a ship's transponder code. Of course, if the ship has a false transponder code, this information can be
worthless anyway.

**Scanning Targets:** The active mode is mainly used in battle used to find better hit locations for example to disable
a particular system on a running frigate or kinetic barrier emitters on a dreadnaught. The base difficulty is as always
10 but the modifiers are opposite of those for the passive mode scans. So the bigger the ship the harder it is to locate
what you are looking for. After locating the system of interest you may choose to attack that specified area for
additional effects, it is up to GM to determine to hit difficulty based on the vessels defense value and the location of
the target. The rule of the thumb is that if you deal half of the ships hit points to a specific system you disable it.

**Scanning Planets:** Scanning for specific objects on a planet's surface can be fairly difficult.

While it's easy to find major landmarks — continents, mountain chains, inland seas and so forth — a planet's geothermal
functions, the energy generated by large settlements, large concentrations of metal, and other energy sources can
distort sensor readings, especially if the sensor is looking for a small facility but scanning a large area. Often,
sensor operators must greatly limit their scanning area — covering perhaps a few square kilometers at a time — to find
military bases, small cities and other "minor" landmarks. The basic sensors difficulty depends upon how much of the
planet is being scanned. No more than half a planet may be scanned because only one hemisphere is visible at any given
time.

Characters normally make a **Passive** general scan of the planet to determine basic characteristics — atmosphere type,
presence of major geographic features, scans for energy readings typical of very large cities — and then conduct
increasingly detailed scans on smaller and smaller areas to determine information about interesting landmarks. These
sample difficulties are for scanning from orbit and finding a specific item — such as a starport, small town, factory
complex, scout base, or industrial compound — when scanning an area of a certain size.

| Active Mode Sensors                                                   | Difficulty     |

| An area one square kilometer or less                                  | Very Easy      |
| An area 100 square kilometers or less                                 | Easy           |
| An area 1,000 square kilometers or less                               | Moderate       |
| An area one million square kilometers or less; an average size nation | Difficult      |
| An area 100 million square kilometers or less; a small continent      | Very Difficult |
| One hemisphere                                                        | Heroic         |
