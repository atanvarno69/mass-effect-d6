# *Bargain* (*Perception*)

*Bargain* is for haggling over prices for goods and services being bought or sold, as well as using bribery.

The GM should use a mixture of roleplaying and die rolls to determine how the character is doing at acquiring selling
the desired goods or services. The player always has the choice to refuse a deal. Similarly, if the GM feels that the
character's roll represents an unfair deal, without the player embellishing by roleplaying the situation, they should
allow the GM's character to refuse the deal as well.

To resolve the haggling, either make an opposed skill check using any modifiers appropriate or select an appropriate
standard difficulty number. Subtract the seller's total from the buyer's total and look up the number on the chart
below. Multiply the price of the item (as credits or a number) by the percentage given to get its final cost. Be certain
to include any price modifiers (as suggested in the [Equipment](equipment.md) chapter) before making the adjustment. If
using Funds, this becomes the new number the Funds roll must meet or exceed.

| Difference  | Price Adjustment           |
| :---------- | :------------------------- |
| ≤ −21       | 300% of local market value |
| −16–20      | 200% of local market value |
| −11–15      | 150% of local market value |
| −6–10       | 125% of local market value |
| −3–5        | 110% of local market value |
| −2 to +2    | At local market value      |
| +3–5        | 90% of local market value  |
| +6–10       | 85% of local market value  |
| +11–15      | 75% of local market value  |
| +16–20      | 65% of local market value  |
| ≥ +21       | 50% of local market value  |

Characters can also employ bargain to "pay" another person to behave dishonorably, such as through ignoring duty,
looking the other way, or divulging secret information. Success depends greatly on the target. A target who is loyal or
wealthy or fears being caught is less likely to accept bribes. Use the difficulties listed under Social Skills and
further modified by such factors as the value of the money, goods, or information offered, the extent of favors given
and received, and the target's attitude toward the bribe.

| Value of Bribe                     | Difficulty Modifier |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| < 50% of what is reasonable        | +10                 |
| 50% to 90% of what is reasonable   | +5                  |
| Larger than expected               | −5                  |
| Significantly larger than expected | −10                 |
