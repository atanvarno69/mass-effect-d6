# *Lift* (*Strength*)

*Lift* covers moving or lifting heavy objects, as well as the ability to inflict additional damage with strength-powered
weapons.

At the GM's discretion, a player may make a *lift* check when their character first picks up an object. (Generally, if
the object's weight would give it a difficulty equal to or greater than one-half of the character's *lift*, rounded up,
or the object is being lifted hastily or under stress, the GM should require a lift roll.) For each round the object is
carried, the character makes another check to see if they can continue to carry the object. If the player fails the
check, their character is too exhausted and must put the object down. If the character is doing anything else at the
time (other than walking slowly or talking), continuing to carry the object counts as a multi-action.

| Lift Fatigue          | Difficulty Modifier |
| :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| 1–6 rounds            | 0                   |
| 7 rounds to 3 minutes | −5                  |
| 3–10 minutes          | −10                 |
| 10–30 minutes         | −15                 |
| 30–60 minutes         | −20                 |

Note: After the first hour, the character must make a check once per hour at the same difficulty as one hour. If the
character fails the roll, then they must rest for twice as long as they were lifting the weight.
