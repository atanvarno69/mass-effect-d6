# Interaction Skills

Characters use *con*, *intimidation*, or *persuasion* to influence other people that they meet. The typical diï¬ƒculty is
10, modified based on the dispositions of the characters involved, but the GM may base it on a skill check (see below
for more information on this).

Die rolls alone should not determine interactions between players characters and NPCs. The GM should have the players
detail what their characters say and do to before rolling the dice. The better the player acts the role of his
character, the greater their chance of success should be, which the GM can reflect by allowing up to a +1D modifier to
the skill roll.

## Mental Defenses
In general, the resistance difficulty for any interaction skill equals 10. The target cannot actively resist unless they
know that an interaction skill is being used on them by another character. If the GM decides that the target suspects
but does not know for certain that someone is attempting to influence them, the GM may allow the character to take an
action earlier than their turn in the round and make a *willpower* or *Knowledge* check to generate a new resistance
difficulty. Should the character decide to actively defend against mental intrusion or personal interaction, they may
devote all of their actions for the round to that task and make a *willpower* or *Knowledge* check, adding +10 to the
score to get the new resistance difficulty. However the interaction resistance difficulty is determined, the GM may
further modify the number as the situation warrants (such as stress, surprise, or character relationship).

## Using in Combat

*Con*, *persuasion*, and *intimidation* can enhance a character's attacks. The player adds one-half of the difference
(positive or negative) between the difficulty and the *con*, *intimidation*, or *persuasion* roll to any one attack made
at Point Blank or Short range. The character must use the benefit from scaring (*intimidation*), tricking (*con*), or
seducing (*persuasion*) the target on the same turn as or on the round after the interaction endeavor.

The user's appearance and demeanor can also affect *persuasion*, *con*, or *intimidation* attempts. The more threatening
the character looks or seems, the less effective *con* and *persuasion* actions are, while *intimidation* attempts are
more effective.

## Interrogation Attempts

Characters may use intimidation or persuasion to get information out of someone. Use the rules for mental defenses to
determine the difficulty and base interaction modifiers. Further modify the number by how important the information is
to the target. A separate *intimidation* check to scare the target can complement an interrogation session.
