# *Stamina* (*Strength*)

*Stamina* covers physical endurance and resistance to pain, disease and poison.

GMs may allow a character to make a multi-action stamina roll to complement a strenuous activity, such as lifting or
running. The difficulty equals 5 × the current fatigue modifier. The character may add one half (rounded up) of the
difference between the successful stamina roll and the difficulty. The strenuous activity still receives the fatigue
modifier. Whenever a character fails a stamina roll, they are fatigued; all actions are at −1D for every stamina check
failed until the character rests for as long as they exerted themself. Characters can still continue if they are
fatigued, until they fail a third stamina check. At this point, the character is completely exhausted and must rest for
twice the amount of time that they exerted themself to remove the penalty.

To avoid the effects of a toxin (inhaled, ingested, or absorbed) or disease (encountered in any manner), a character
makes a *stamina* check. Several factors figure into the difficulty of the attempt, including the deadliness and dosage
of the poison in question. For example, a fatal bout of botulism has a difficulty of 9, while a killing dose of cyanide
has a difficulty of 42.

Characters may attempt to counter toxins once per day. GMs might also call for *stamina* rolls against falling asleep
or unconscious. Resisting sleep is a difficulty of 5 per hour beyond the normal awake time, modified by environmental
factors.
