# Repair Skills

Though there are many different kinds of repair skills, they all follow the same principles. The base difficulty to fix
or modify anything is 10.

The amount of damage sustained, the character's familiarity with the item, availability of parts, and complexity of the
task can modify the difficulty. The GM may require a separate check to determine whether the character can figure out
how to repair an unknown item. Destroyed parts must be replaced, which raises the difficulty. Additionally, if a
character rushes the job, not only is there an increased chance of failure, but the item could also break again soon
after its next use.
