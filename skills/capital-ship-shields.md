# *Capital Ship Shields* (*Mechanical*)

*Time Taken:* 1 round.

Characters use this skill when operating shields on capital-scale starships, both military and civilian. These shields
normally require large, coordinated crews for efficient operation.

Capital ship shields can be used to bring up shields — a reaction skill — to block enemy fire.
