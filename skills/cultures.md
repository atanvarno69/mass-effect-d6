# *Cultures* (*Knowledge*)

This is an [information skill](information-skills.md).

*Cultures* reflects knowledge of particular cultures and common cultural forms (primitive tribal civilizations tend to
be somewhat similar, for example). The *cultures* skill allows a character to determine how they are expected to behave
in a particular situation among a certain group of individuals. The more obscure the information or culture, the higher
the difficulty. Cultural knowledge includes information about a certain group's art, history, politics, customs, rites
of passage, and views on outsiders. For instance, a visitor to Tuchanka might make a cultures role to better understand
the "rite of passage".

This skill can be used for cultures of one's own species or for those of other species.
