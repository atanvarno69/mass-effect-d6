the opponent is actively watching for tricks) or as a derived value equal tthe opponent’s attribute or skill dice × 2 +
pips.

Characters also may use *sleight of hand* to pick locks, but they may not attempt to do so without some kind of tools
(hairpins, wire coat hanger, telekinesis, etc.). Improvised tools do not add to character's skill roll, but specialized
tools will.
