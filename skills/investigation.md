# *Investigation* (*Perception*)

*Investigation* is used for gathering information, researching topics, analyzing data, and piecing together clues.

When used to research a topic, a separate check must be made for each source checked.

| Research Situation                                                                                      | Difficulty |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------- |
| Common knowledge                                                                                        | 7          |
| Requires searching through several sources; introductory theories                                       | 12         |
| Sources of varying reliability; cutting-edge information; specific information about harmless individual/event |  18 |
| Esoteric information; specific information about dangerous individual or event                          | 24         |

| Research Condition                                 | Difficulty Modifier |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Information closely guarded                        | +5                  |
| Character unsure of information sought             | +5                  |
| Character knows exactly what information is sought | −5                  |

When used to figure out clues from a crime scene, the base difficulty is 10. The character must use *search* first to
find the clues or evidence (or have them pointed out); *investigation* helps the character figure out what they mean.

| Evidence is fairly clear; many clues; familiar objects with expected use                       | −6                  |
| Evidence is partially clear; several clues; familiar objects with uncommon use, or unfamiliar objects with common use | 0
| Evidence is obscure; few clues                                                                 | +3                  |
| Evidence is unusual or with no apparent significance; uncommon objects with uncommon use       | +6                  |
| Repeatedly commits similar crimes (per crime)                                                  | −3                  |
| Distance between crimes (per 80 kilometers)                                                    | +3                  |
| Time between crimes (per 6 months*)                                                            | +3                  |

\* While the crimes may have been committed over a greater time interval, the maximum value for this modifier is +30
