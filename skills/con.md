# *Con* (*Perception*)

This is an [interaction skill](interaction-skills.md).

*Con* covers bluffing, lying, tricking, or deceiving others, as well as verbal evasiveness, misdirection, blustering,
and altering features or clothing to be unrecognizable or to look like someone else. Also useful in putting on acting
performances.

In addition to tricking people verbally, a character can use *con* to change their appearance. The character's skill
check total in creating the disguise serves two related purposes. First, the higher the total, the less likely an
observer will question the disguise. Second, the skill check total becomes the difficulty number for *Perception* or
*investigation* efforts to see through it. If the *investigation* check is higher than the *con* check total, the
disguise has been penetrated. If at any time while the character is disguised they perform an action inconsistent with
the disguise, any observer has a chance to see through it. Although one character may use *con* to alter the features of
another character, the disguised character must actively work at keeping up the disguise using their own *con* skill or
*Perception*.
