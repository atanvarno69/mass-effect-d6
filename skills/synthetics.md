# *Synthetics* (*Technical*)

This is a [programming skill](programming-skills.md).

*Synthetics* covers programming and using synthetics like robots and mechs.

Most robots and mechs do not have attributes, though sophisticated ones might. Instead, skills and their specializations
represent the tasks a robot can perform. The programmer must have a means of inputting information into the robot, such
as a computer terminal or hand computer.

The time taken depends upon the complexity of the task -- a Very Easy program might take only half an hour to program,
but a Very Difficult one might take days or weeks to program. Once the robot has the basic skill, skill cartridges or
additional programming can upgrade it.

| Program                                                   | Difficulty |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Specialization of a skill (first 3)                       | 5          |
| Additional +1 pip in previously programmed specialization | 10         |
| Full skill (first 3)                                      | 15         |
| Additional +1 pip in previously programmed skill          | 5          |
| An attribute (first 1D)                                   | 25         |
| Additional +1 pip in previously programmed attribute      | 15         |
| Reformatting main memory (not hardwired memory)           | 15         |

| Situation                                                                            | Difficulty Modifier |
