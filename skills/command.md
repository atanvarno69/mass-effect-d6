# *Command* (*Perception*)

*Command* covers the act of convincing individuals to comply with specific directions, as well as maintaining morale
during group undertakings (such as combat or building large pieces of equipment). This skill is typically used only on
the GM's characters, though sometimes it may be attempted with players' characters (such situations should be roleplayed
first, with a bonus or penalty to the *command* check based on how well the group participated in the activity
together). A high command check can complement individual participants' checks in a group activity, while a low command
check can impose negative modifiers.

It generally requires at least one round of planning to perform effectively. Characters can use this skill to combine
their attacks. One person is designated the leader and makes the command roll. If successful, everyone goes on the
leader's initiative. Participants make their attacks with the hit location modifier (to reflect that they're aiming for
a designated location), but the target resists the combined total of all damage done to it. If the command roll fails,
determine initiative and actions individually.
