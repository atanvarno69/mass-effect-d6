# *Tactics* (*Knowledge*)

*Tactics* represents a character's skill in deploying military forces and maneuvering them for the best advantage.
Characters can rely on it for general knowledge of how best to stage a military operation or the best response to an
opponent's move in battle. Tactics attempts can complement command and combat rolls for the group the character advises.
The better the result, the more details the GM should give to help the character win the battle. Hints can take the form
of reminders about different moves the enemy can make, suggestions on how to maneuver the character's forces, or (for
especially good rolls) risky and unanticipated moves that could throw the enemy off guard. Nonetheless, characters
should keep in mind that *tactics* might suggest a theoretically optimum solution, but the execution might not come off
as well as planned.

*Tactics* difficulties should be based on various factors of complexity within a battle: how many units are involved,
the setting (empty space, asteroid field, planetary terrain), and the difference in training and equipment between units
(battleships versus in-system defenders; trained mercenaries versus primitive natives; space military versus experienced
rebels).
