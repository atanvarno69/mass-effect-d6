# *Scholar* (*Knowledge*)

**Specializations:** Particular field of study â€” archaeology, history, geology, physics

This is an [information skill](information-skills.md).

*Scholar* covers formal academic training or dedicated research in a particular field. *Scholar* also reflects a
character's ability to find information through research. Characters often choose a specialization to reflect a specific
area which they have studied. Specializations are subjects often taught at the great universities throughout the galaxy,
including archaeology, botany, chemistry, geology, history, ftl theories, and physics. Specializations can also be
topics a character can research on their own.

*Scholar* represents "book-learning," not information learned from practical experience. A character can know the
various ftl theories inside and out, but this doesn't qualify them to fly starships through hyperspace (that's covered
by the *navigation* skill). They might know the physical principles which make a gun fire, but that doesn't make them a
better shot. The GM can choose to allow players a limited benefit under certain circumstances -- the character is
applying theory in a real-world situation. For example, a character with *scholar: military tactics* (the history of
tactics) normally doesn't get a bonus to *tactics* checks, but under certain circumstances, a good *scholar: military
tactics* roll might merit a small (+2D or so) bonus to *tactics*. GMs should allow players to choose their own scholar
specializations -- new ones can be created at the GM's discretion. When determining a character's background, players
should explain why and how they gained such academic training in a field. Like many other Knowledge skills, the
difficulty is based on the obscurity and detail of the information sought.
