# *Forgery* (*Perception*)

The *artist* skill may complement this skill, or the GM may require it to be used instead, with the appropriate
*forgery* modifiers applied. Reduce the amount of time spent on creating a forgery if the character has repeatedly
succeeded at making similar items in the past.

using one of these modifiers.
