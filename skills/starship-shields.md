# *Starship Shields* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** 1 round

*Starship shields* is a skill used to operate shields on all starship-scale ships. The difficulty of the roll is
determined by how many fire arcs the character is trying to raise shields over (front, left, right, back).

See [Space](../space.md).

*Starship shields* can be used to bring up shields — a "reaction skill" — to block enemy fire.
