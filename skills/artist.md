# *Artist* (*Perception*)

*Artist* covers making works of art, like paintings, photographs, and music or literary compositions.

The time needed to perform the *artist* skill varies, depending on the quality and complexity of a piece. A simple
amateur piece may only take a few minutes, while a complex, prize-winning endeavor could require weeks or months.
Characters may also use this skill to judge works of art created by others and possibly as a complementary skill to
forgery to detect fake artistic pieces. The higher the total is above the creation total for the piece, the more
information the judge knows about it (such as flaws, alterations, its creator, and the like).
