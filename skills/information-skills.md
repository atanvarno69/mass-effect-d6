# Information Skills

The *Knowledge* attribute assists characters in finding out how much they know about a certain field, modified depending
on the situation. For this reason, one chart of general difficulties can serve most uses of *Knowledge*, several
*Knowledge*-based skills, and *investigation* attempts involving researching a topic.

The GM can employ the difficulties below in one of two ways: by picking a difficulty based on what the character seeks
or wants to recall, or by comparing the skill total rolled to the difficulties (whichever level the character meets or
beats is the amount and type of information collected or recollected). Realize that the less well-defined the skill is,
the less information the character knows or finds.

One high roll in any of these skills does not necessarily make the character an expert in that field. The roll
represents only what the character recalls at the time. A high roll could reveal a specific detail of the information
sought, as well as some hints for discovering more of what the character seeks.

Characters may be assumed to have a general knowledge of their home country, culture, and era, including basic
geography, famous people, and common etiquette.
