# *Business* (*Knowledge*)

This is an [information skill](information-skills.md).

*Business* is a character's working knowledge of businesses and business procedures. A character skilled in *business*
might want to run their own company, or knows how to convince a warehouse manager to give them a tour of a facility or
to allow them to "borrow" a few things in an emergency. Characters with a high *business* skill know how much it costs
companies to produce goods and will be able to negotiate for good prices direct from a company or distributor. The
character probably has several contacts in the business world and can get special favors done for them if they are
somewhere where the company has a lot of power.

Discovering information about businesses is also possible with the *business* skill. Most stores, shops, and markets are
Easy to figure out, while factories, service facilities, and public works range from Moderate to Very Difficult
depending on their complexity and how much their workers/owners/supervisors want to hide the information from the
public. An Heroic business task would be trying to find out how much the Shadow Broker is making from legitimate
companies.
