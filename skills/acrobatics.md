# *Acrobatics* (*Dexterity*)

*Acrobatics* is the skill for performing feats of gymnastics, extraordinary balance, and dance (and related performance
arts), as well as breaking falls and escaping from bonds.

**Reaction:** During a fall, *acrobatics* may be used to reduce bodily harm. If the character has not already used all
their actions for the turn, they may use an action to attempt to land properly. The character makes an acrobatics check.
For every five points over the difficulty of 10 (+ any condition modifiers), the character reduces the damage total by
one point, in addition to a base reduction of one point, to a minimum of 0 damage.

| Maneuver                                               | Difficulty |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Fall damage reduction                                  | 10         |
| Somersault; pirouette                                  | 5          |
| Handspring; cartwheel; handstand                       | 10         |
| Swing over a obstacle                                  | 10         |
| Round-off; backflip                                    | 15         |
| Vaulting over an obstacle                              | 15         |
| Bouncing off a surface to reach a specific destination | 20         |
| Walking up a wall*                                     | 30         |

\* A character may "walk" a maximum of their *Move* in one round; they must have a flat surface to stop on at the end of
their turn or they fall and take damage from the fall.

| Condition                                                         | Difficulty modifier |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Flat surface to flat surface                                      | 0                   |
| Unlimited landing area                                            | âˆ’3                  |
| Limited landing area                                              | +3                  |
| Almost no landing area                                            | +6                  |
| Rough or unsteady landing area                                    | +3 or more          |
| High surface to low surface                                       | +3                  |
| Low surface to high surface                                       | +6                  |
| Slippery surface                                                  | +3                  |
| Strong wind                                                       | +3                  |
| Add a twist of the body (per twist)                               | +3                  |
| Performing the maneuver underwater or backwards                   | +3                  |
| Performing the maneuver in the air (such as on a trapeze or bars) | +9                  |
| Performing the maneuver on a narrow surface                       | +6                  |

**Note:** A character may combine one or more maneuvers in the same action. In this case, use the difficulty of the most
challenging maneuver, add +3 for each additional maneuver (up to five additional maneuvers), and include modifiers as if
the complex stunt was one maneuver.

*Acrobatics* can also aid a character in escaping from bonds. The chart below contains sample difficulty numbers for
escaping from various kinds of restraints. Modify the difficulty based on the circumstances of the escape, such as the
conditions the character works under or specially designed restraints. The character may not use this skill if
completely immobilized. If in multiple restraints, the character must make a separate roll for each one. A critical
failure indicates that the character has pulled a muscle (and he does their *Strength* damage to themself).

This skill does not substitute for *sleight of hand*. The character may be able to pull their arms over their head to
use their hands, but they may not be able to slip out of the handcuffs unless they are improperly secured.

| Restraint    | Difficulty |
| :----------- | :--------- |
| Ropes        | 13         |
| Wires, chain | 15         |
| Handcuffs    | 16         |
| Straitjacket | 18         |
