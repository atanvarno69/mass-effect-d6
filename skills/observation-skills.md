# Observation Skills

The GM can use these difficulties for situations involving the gathering of information.

To see if a character notices details of a scene or situation, the GM may have the player make a *Perception* roll.
Unless the characters are actively eavesdropping, searching, tracking, or performing a similar activity (and thus using
the *search* skill), this passive observance of a scene does not count as an action. If the skill total meets or beats
the difficulty, the character gains that much information.
