# *Search* (*Perception*)

This is an [observation skill](observation-skills.md).

When used to eavesdrop on or secretly watch an event or another character, the skill total indicates the amount of
information gained from the surveillance. Use the "Observation Difficulties" table found at the beginning of this
chapter. A critical failure could mean anything from no information obtained to being immediately spotted by the
character being observed, depending on the situation.

When searching for a hidden object or person, the difficulty is generally the *hide* check used to conceal the target.
Otherwise, the base difficulty is 5, modified by the table below.

See also "Observation Skills" in this chapter for more difficulties and modifiers for this skill.
