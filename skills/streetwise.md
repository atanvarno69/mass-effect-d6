# *Streetwise* (*Knowledge*)

*Streetwise* covers finding information, goods, and contacts in an urban environment, particularly through criminal
organizations, black markets, and other illicit operations. It is also useful for determining possible motives and
methods of criminals.

Generally, the modifiers are the same for each situation, but the GM should adjust them depending on the circumstances.
It is possible, though generally unlikely, that a character would be well-liked by both upstanding residents and local
criminals.
