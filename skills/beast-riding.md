# *Beast Riding* (*Perception*)

*Beast riding* covers riding and otherwise handling non-sentient creatures.

When a character first mounts a ridable animal, they must make a *beast riding* check against the creature's
*willpower*. The character's *beast riding* total may be modified by the attitude of the animal toward the character.

* Success: The character stays in control.
* Fail: See table below.

| *Beast riding* check failure | Beast's reaction                                 |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2                          | Beast stops and refuses to move for 1 round.     |
| 3–6                          | Beast stops and refuses to move for 2 rounds.    |
| 7–11                         | Beast bolts in a random direction for 1D rounds. |
| ≥ 12                         | Beast bucks rider; rider must make a moderate *beast riding* check to avoid being thrown off. |

When attempting to get the beast to perform a special maneuver or during events that might frighten it, the character
must make a *beast riding* check against the animal's *Knowledge* or *willpower*. Examples of special maneuvers include
jumping a fence, crossing a raging river, moving faster, or slowing down quickly. (The success of special maneuvers is
determined with the animal's attributes or skills.)

A character attacking from the back of a beast takes a multi-action penalty for having to both control the mount and use
a weapon.
