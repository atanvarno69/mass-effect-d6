# *Planetary Systems* (*Knowledge*)

This is an [information skill](information-skills.md).

*Planetary systems* reflects a character's general knowledge of geography, weather, life-forms, trade products,
settlements, technology, government and other general information about different systems and planets. Much of this
information is gained from personal experience, computer records and hearsay from others who have visited various
systems. Characters specializing in particular planets have a deeper knowledge of more subtle details more than the
average general database would contain. Although someone with an improved planetary systems skill would know that
Tuchanka wastelands are home to Trasher Maws.

The *Planetary systems* difficulty is based on how obscure the system is:

| System                                                                                                  | Difficulty |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------- |
| Systems that everyone has heard of and knows something about like the Citadel                           | 6          |
| Systems that most people will have heard of, but they will only know one or two things about; Earth     | 9          |
| Systems that the average person might have heard of, but they probably know nothing about; Tuschanka    | 16         |
| Very obscure systems that most people will never have heard of, or maybe they've heard of it but have no interest in learning anything about it; IIos | 20 |
| Systems that very few people have ever heard of, and even then, only a small percentage know anything of it beyond its name; Argos Rho Cluster | 24 |
| Systems that almost no one has ever heard of; The system may not even be on the star charts; An unexplored system that might have been visited by traders; Far Rim | â‰¥ 30 |

Difficulty modifiers depend on whether the information a character seeks is common or obscure. The more obscure the
information, the more difficult it is to recall:

| Obscurity                                                                                      | Difficulty Modifier |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Information is very common or easily figured out from quick observation; All natives and most visitors know this | 0 |
| Information is common, but requires some observation or investigation; All natives will know this; many visitors might | +1-5 |
| Information is obscure and requires detailed observation; Most natives know this information, but most visitors don't | +6-10 |
| Information isn't well known; Significant observation and investigation is needed to discover this | +11-20          |
| Only a select few individuals know this; The information is restricted or not well distributed to the galaxy at large | +21 |
