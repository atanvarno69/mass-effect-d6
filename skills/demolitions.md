# *Demolitions* (*Technical*)

*Demolitions* covers setting explosives to achieve particular destructive effects.

The base difficulty is stated in the explosive description, otherwise it is 10.

For extra damage and special effects, the character must spend one round per difficulty number setting up the
explosives. The character also needs to indicate how much explosive they are using. If the attempt is successful,
compare the skill total with the object's damage resistance total (its Toughness modified by size, thickness, flaws,
supports, etc.). Items that take at least 10 points above their damage resistance total are severely damaged, if not
destroyed. Items taking less than that are weakened, and another attempt may be made (with the object having a reduced
damage resistance total and possibly other problems).

Remember that, while a character may think an object is constructed of one type of material, it may not be. Though this
does not alter the difficulty of setting the explosive, it may change the results of special effects. For instance, an
explosive set for thin wood won't do much good if that's only a veneer for reinforced steel.

| Object Construction                    | Toughness |

| Tough (hard wooden door, most guns)    | 12        |
| Sturdy (bolted steel door, small safe) | 18        |
| Very sturdy (a few layers of steel)    | 24        |
| Reinforced (numerous layers of steel)  | 36        |
