## *Omni-Blade* (*Strength*)

This skill is a close combat skill.

The *Omni-blade* skill is basic in using the Technical Talent *Omni-blade*. The blade is activated and appears out of
the combatants Omni-tool and is a weapon in close combat. The *Omni-blade* skill is used just like the *Melee* skill for
other Melee weapons.

Note: The *Omni-blade* skill requires the *Omni-blade* talent to use and an Omni-tool on the user's wrist.

## *Persuasion* (*Perception*)

This is a Social skill.

Influencing others or getting information out of them through bribery, honest discussion, debate, diplomacy, speeches,
friendliness, flattery, or seduction. Also useful in negotiations, business transactions, and putting on performances
(such as singing, acting, or storytelling).

## *Planetary Systems* (*Knowledge*)

This skill reflects a character's general knowledge of geography, weather, life-forms, trade products, settlements,
technology, government and other general information about different systems and planets. Much of this information is
gained from personal experience, computer records and hearsay from others who have visited various systems. Characters
specializing in particular planets have a deeper knowledge of more subtle details more than the average general database
would contain. Although someone with an improved planetary systems skill would know that Tuschanka wastelands are home
to Trasher Maws.

The *Planetary systems* difficulty is based on how obscure the system is:

| System                                                                                                  | Difficulty |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------- |
| Systems that everyone has heard of and knows something about like the Citadel                           | 6          |
| Systems that most people will have heard of, but they will only know one or two things about; Earth     | 9          |
| Systems that the average person might have heard of, but they probably know nothing about; Tuschanka    | 16         |
| Very obscure systems that most people will never have heard of, or maybe they've heard of it but have no interest in learning anything about it; IIos | 20 |
| Systems that very few people have ever heard of, and even then, only a small percentage know anything of it beyond its name; Argos Rho Cluster | 24 |
| Systems that almost no one has ever heard of; The system may not even be on the star charts; An unexplored system that might have been visited by traders; Far Rim | ≥ 30 |

Difficulty modifiers depend on whether the information a character seeks is common or obscure. The more obscure the
information, the more difficult it is to recall:

| Obscurity                                                                                      | Difficulty Modifier |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Information is very common or easily figured out from quick observation; All natives and most visitors know this | 0 |
| Information is common, but requires some observation or investigation; All natives will know this; many visitors might | +1-5 |
| Information is obscure and requires detailed observation; Most natives know this information, but most visitors don't | +6-10 |
| Information isn't well known; Significant observation and investigation is needed to discover this | +11-20          |
| Only a select few individuals know this; The information is restricted or not well distributed to the galaxy at large | +21 |

## *Ranged* (*Dexterity*)

This skill is a ranged combat skill.

The *Ranged* skill is used to shoot pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, submachine guns or sniper rifles, that can be
held, carried and fired by one person.

## *Rocket Pack Operation* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** One round or longer

This is a piloting skill.

Rocket pack operation covers jet packs, rocket packs and all other mass effect propelled and gliding equipment.

## *Rover Operation* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** One round or longer

**Specializations:** Type or model ground vehicle — Mako, Tomkah

This is a piloting skill.

Rover operation covers wheeled and tracked personal transportation cars and bikes, and cargo haulers.

## *Scholar* (*Knowledge*)

**Specializations:** Particular field of study — archaeology, history, geology, physics.

This skill reflects formal academic training or dedicated research in a particular field. *Scholar* also reflects a
character's ability to find information through research. Characters often choose a specialization to reflect a specific
area which they have studied. Specializations are subjects often taught at the great universities throughout the galaxy,
including archaeology, botany, chemistry, geology, history, ftl theories, and physics. Specializations can also be
topics a character can research on their own.

*Scholar* represents "book-learning," not information learned from practical experience. A character can know the
various ftl theories inside and out, but this doesn't qualify them to fly starships through hyperspace (that's covered
by the *navigation* skill). They might know the physical principles which make a gun fire, but that doesn't make them a
better shot. The GM can choose to allow players a limited benefit under certain circumstances — the character is
applying theory in a real-world situation. For example, a character with *scholar: military tactics* (the history of
tactics) normally doesn't get a bonus to *tactics* checks, but under certain circumstances, a good *scholar: military
tactics* roll might merit a small (+2D or so) bonus to *tactics*. GMs should allow players to choose their own scholar
specializations — new ones can be created at the GM's discretion. When determining a character's background, players
should explain why and how they gained such academic training in a field. Like many other Knowledge skills, the
difficulty is based on the obscurity and detail of the information sought.

## *Search* (*Perception*)

When used to eavesdrop on or secretly watch an event or another character, the skill total indicates the amount of
information gained from the surveillance. Use the "Observation Difficulties" table found at the beginning of this
chapter. A critical failure could mean anything from no information obtained to being immediately spotted by the
character being observed, depending on the situation.

When searching for a hidden object or person, the difficulty is generally the *hide* check used to conceal the target.
Otherwise, the base difficulty is 5, modified by the table below.

See also "Observation Skills" in this chapter for more difficulties and modifiers for this skill.

| Situation                                                                              | Difficulty Modifier |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Character knows target’s exact location                                                | 0                   |
| Character knows target’s approximate location                                          | +5                  |
| Character has vague information about the target or its location                       | +15                 |
| Character has only general idea of what she’s looking for; searching for small objects | +20                 |
| Character has no idea what she’s looking for; searching for obscure or tiny objects    | +25                 |
| Searching for microscopic objects*                                                     | +30                 |

\* Might not be possible without special equipment or abilities.

When attempting to track someone, the base difficulty is 10 or the target's *sneak* check, if the target is actively
trying to hide their trail.

Characters can also use *search* to shadow a target.

| Condition                                           | Difficulty Modifier |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Trail is a day old                                  | +3                  |
| Trail is a few days old                             | +6                  |

| Rain forest, dense crowd                            | +6                  |
| Desert, arctic wasteland, hard surface              | +9                  |
| Number of people being tracked (for every 2 people) | −3                  |
| Tracking a wheeled vehicle                          | −6                  |
| Per additional vehicle                              | −3                  |

## *Sensors* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** 1 round or longer

**Specializations:** Type or model scanner — hand scanner, med diagnostic scanner, heat sensor

Characters with the this skill can operate various kinds of sensors, including those that detect life forms, identify
vehicles, pick up energy readings, and make long-distance visual readings. Sensors skill covers everything from portable
hand scanners to the huge sensor arrays used on capital ships and in military bases.

Note: Sensors may be used as a plot devices: the characters should detect just enough to intrigue them. They'll have to
personally investigate the situation to find out the whole story.

While there are plenty of sensors modifiers to choose from, don't be afraid to keep things simple! Pick a difficulty
number using your judgement. If the character beats the difficulty number, they detect something; if they roll really
well, they will be able to get very detailed information. One *sensors* check can be made per round: the character
detects everything they rolled well enough to notice.

*Sensors* can perform two distinct tasks: detection and identification:

**Active mode** is when a sensor detects something, it means that it has noticed the object. The sensors can detect
specific parts of a ship but cannot give you any more information on their function, for that you use passive mode.

**Passive mode** is when a sensor identifies something, it means that the sensor can identify specific things like
temperature, life forms, radio waves or heat.

| Passive Mode Sensors                                               | Modifier                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Target is using a sensor decoy, sensors detect both ship and decoy | +5 difficulty                        |
| Target ship is running silent (See [Space](space.md))              | +15 or more difficulty               |
| Ship is hiding behind planet or other massive body                 | +10 or more difficulty               |
| Ship has other mass objects, such as asteroids, to hide among      | +20 difficulty                       |
| Targeting a small natural body; a small asteroid                   | +1D+2 to the character's roll        |
| Target is the size of a capital ship or a decent-sized asteroid    | +3D+1 to the character's roll        |
| Planetary or moon-sized natural body like the Citadel              | +6D+2 to the character's roll        |
| Stellar object; a star, nebula, black hole                         | +10D or more to the character's roll |

If the sensor operator scans a ship with passive scanners and beats the *sensors* difficulty by 10 or more points, they
can pick out a ship's transponder code. Of course, if the ship has a false transponder code, this information can be
worthless anyway.

**Scanning Targets:** The active mode is mainly used in battle used to find better hit locations for example to disable
a particular system on a running frigate or kinetic barrier emitters on a dreadnaught. The base difficulty is as always
10 but the modifiers are opposite of those for the passive mode scans. So the bigger the ship the harder it is to locate
what you are looking for. After locating the system of interest you may choose to attack that specified area for
additional effects, it is up to GM to determine to hit difficulty based on the vessels defense value and the location of
the target. The rule of the thumb is that if you deal half of the ships hit points to a specific system you disable it.

**Scanning Planets:** Scanning for specific objects on a planet's surface can be fairly difficult.

While it's easy to find major landmarks — continents, mountain chains, inland seas and so forth — a planet's geothermal
functions, the energy generated by large settlements, large concentrations of metal, and other energy sources can
distort sensor readings, especially if the sensor is looking for a small facility but scanning a large area. Often,
sensor operators must greatly limit their scanning area — covering perhaps a few square kilometers at a time — to find
military bases, small cities and other "minor" landmarks. The basic sensors difficulty depends upon how much of the
planet is being scanned. No more than half a planet may be scanned because only one hemisphere is visible at any given
time.

Characters normally make a **Passive** general scan of the planet to determine basic characteristics — atmosphere type,
presence of major geographic features, scans for energy readings typical of very large cities — and then conduct
increasingly detailed scans on smaller and smaller areas to determine information about interesting landmarks. These
sample difficulties are for scanning from orbit and finding a specific item — such as a starport, small town, factory
complex, scout base, or industrial compound — when scanning an area of a certain size.

| Active Mode Sensors                                                   | Difficulty     |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| An area one square kilometer or less                                  | Very Easy      |
| An area 100 square kilometers or less                                 | Easy           |
| An area 1,000 square kilometers or less                               | Moderate       |
| An area one million square kilometers or less; an average size nation | Difficult      |
| An area 100 million square kilometers or less; a small continent      | Very Difficult |
| One hemisphere                                                        | Heroic         |

| Active Mode Condition                                                           | Modifiers                          |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| Looking for telltale energy emissions, such as emissions from spaceships        | +5-20 or more difficulty           |
| Specific signal is hidden among other similar emissions or in an area where other signals will overwhelm that object's signal. (A ship flying among volcanoes to disguise its trail) | + 10 or more difficulty |
| Identifying a specific life form if there are many different species in an area | +5 or more difficulty              |
| Looking for basic information. Location of major continents, planet's atmosphere and gravity, general composition of land masses | +25 or more to the character's roll |
| Looking for major sources of heat, light and other energy sources; by default, other, non-energy emitting areas, such as glaciers, can be found. | +10 to the character's roll |
| Looking for major landmarks; Mountain chains, forests, large lakes, or cities  | +5-15 to the character's roll       |
| Finding life forms if life form is known and there are massive concentrations of them (determining that humans live on a planet if there are thousands of them clustered in a small area) | +5 or more to the character's roll |
| Spotting or identifying a specific life form if it is very different from all other life forms around it | +5 or more to the character's roll
| Following an energy trail left by an incoming starship                         | +10 or more to the character's roll |

## *Shield* (*Strength*)

*Shield* is a combat skill and allows the player to use heavy combat shields. Normally the combat shields are used by
high profile military and mercenary personnel. The shield in itself is a high density polymer that absorbs vast amounts
of damage, but is also very heavy. That's why only people wearing a Medium or Heavy armor with Exoskeleton or Crusher
Mods can operate this kind of defense equipment. When a character uses the shield the DV is raised by the Shield skill
number.

## *SkyCar Operation* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** 1 round or longer

This is a piloting skill.

SkyCars are dangerously fast, difficult to pilot vehicles. *SkyCar operation* reflects a character's ability to
successfully fly what is little more than a powerful engine with a seat. For all modifiers and difficulty levels check
piloting skill chart at the beginning of the chapter.

## *Sleight of Hand* (*Dexterity*)

The difficulty for a *sleight of hand* attempt is usually the opponent's *Perception* or *search*, either as a check (if
the opponent is actively watching for tricks) or as a derived value equal tthe opponent’s attribute or skill dice × 2 +
pips.

| Situation                                                                                    | Difficulty Modifier |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Watchful target; few distractions                                                            | +9                  |
| Observant target; light crowd                                                                | +6                  |
| Suspicious target                                                                            | +3                  |
| Challenging act (such as palming a baseball)                                                 | +6 or more          |
| Unobservant target; target constantly jostled; major distractions                            | −9                  |
| Confused or distracted target; crowded conditions; minor distractions                        | −6                  |
| Simple act (such as palming a tiny object or sliding a hand into one’s own pocket unnoticed) | −6 or more          |

Characters also may use *sleight of hand* to pick locks, but they may not attempt to do so without some kind of tools
(hairpins, wire coat hanger, telekinesis, etc.). Improvised tools do not add to character's skill roll, but specialized
tools will.

| Type of Lock                 | Difficulty |
| :--------------------------- | :--------- |
| Simple key lock              | 6          |
| Complex key lock             | 12         |
| Combination lock             | 18         |

| Lock Condition               | Difficulty Modifier |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Poorly constructed           | −6                  |
| Well constructed             | +2                  |
| Military or security style   | +6                  |
| High security style          | +9                  |
| Lock blueprints and diagrams | −4                  |

## *Sneak* (*Perception*)

*Sneak* is used when you want to hide. The difficulty for of the attempt is usually the opponent's *Perception* or
*search*, either as a check (if the opponent is actively trying to find you) or as a derived value equal to the
opponent’s attribute or skill dice × 2 + pips.

| Condition                                                    | Difficulty Modifier |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Heavy rain or snow                                           | −3                  |
| Dawn, dusk, fog, many trees, large crowd, etc.               | −2                  |
| Night                                                        | −10                 |
| Inattentive observer                                         | −5                  |
| Dense concealment (thick jungle, crowd of people in costume) | −5                  |
| Many distractions (party, parade, combat)                    | −10                 |
| Attentive observer                                           | +6                  |
| Open terrain                                                 | +6                  |
| Good lighting                                                | +6                  |
| Several observers                                            | +9                  |

## *Stamina* (*Strength*)

GMs may allow a character to make a multi-action stamina roll to complement a strenuous activity, such as lifting or
running. The difficulty equals 5 × the current fatigue modifier. The character may add one half (rounded up) of the
difference between the successful stamina roll and the difficulty. The strenuous activity still receives the fatigue
modifier. Whenever a character fails a stamina roll, they are fatigued; all actions are at −1D for every stamina check
failed until the character rests for as long as they exerted themself. Characters can still continue if they are
fatigued, until they fail a third stamina check. At this point, the character is completely exhausted and must rest for
twice the amount of time that they exerted themself to remove the penalty.

To avoid the effects of a toxin (inhaled, ingested, or absorbed) or disease (encountered in any manner), a character
makes a *stamina* check. Several factors figure into the difficulty of the attempt, including the deadliness and dosage
of the poison in question. For example, a fatal bout of botulism has a difficulty of 9, while a killing dose of cyanide
has a difficulty of 42.

Characters may attempt to counter toxins once per day. GMs might also call for *stamina* rolls against falling asleep
or unconscious. Resisting sleep is a difficulty of 5 per hour beyond the normal awake time, modified by environmental
factors.

## *Starship Gunnery* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** 1 round

**Specializations:** Specific type or model weapon — disrupt torpedo or mass accelerator cannons

This skill is a ranged combat skill.

It covers all starship-scale weapons.

## *Starship Mechanics* (*Technical*)

This is a repair skill.

It used for mechanical repairs and maintenance of a vessel, this includes all work replacing and keeping the ship in
working condition.

## *Starship Piloting* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** 1 round or longer

**Specializations:** Type or model — SX3 Alliance Fighter, Kawloon Class Freighter

This is a piloting skill.

It is used to pilot all non-capital scale vessels like gunships, shuttles, fighters and freighters. For all modifiers
and difficulty levels check movement skill chart at the beginning of the chapter.

## *Starship Shields* (*Mechanical*)

**Time Taken:** 1 round

*Starship shields* is a skill used to operate shields on all starship-scale ships. The difficulty of the roll is
determined by how many fire arcs the character is trying to raise shields over (front, left, right, back).

See [Space](space.md).

*Starship shields*  can be used to bring up shields — a "reaction skill" — to block enemy fire.

## *Starship Systems* (*Technical*)

This is a programming skill.

*Starship systems* is used for programing all ships computer systems.
