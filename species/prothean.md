## Species Characteristics

**Awareness:** Protheans gain a +1D bonus to initiative.

**Thick Carapace:** Prothean bodies are covered with a thick, layered carapace that gives them +2 to their natural
damage resistance.

**Experience Transfer:** By touching something or someone, a Prothean can recall its experiences. This ability enables
transfer of complex ideas, with a Prothean being capable of learning a new skill or foreign language with a single
touch. Protheans may learn new skills at 5 point cost and may also recall experiences and memories of others by paying 1
character point. In that case the GM is required to disclose any information from the target to the player after a
successful very difficult Willpower roll.

**Imperial Guard:** At character creation Protheans gain +2 in *ranged*, *melee*, *tactics* and *command* (maximum of
+6).

**Synthetic Hatred:** Protheans condemn all synthetic life forms, they believe it is the root of all evil that has
befallen them. Protheans will go out of their way to destroy any synthetic. You canâ€™t have a Prothean and a Geth in one
party.

**Cosmic Imperative:** Protheans believe it to be the driving force in the universe and that the strong must flourish by
dominating the weak for the greater good of all. That is why they are very headstrong in their pursuits. It is almost
impossible to persuade a Prothean to change a chosen course of action (add 2 levels of difficulty to any standard roll).

**Unique Armor:** All armor worn a Prothean must be custom made, add 50% to the cost of any armor for the Prothean. Also
all customization takes time the GM should decide accordingly.

## Background

**Physical Appearance:** Protheans are an anthropoidal race. They have two pairs of eyes with each eye possessing dual
pupils, and three pairs of nostrils. Their eyes have some ability to see through cloaked objects or entities. Their
heads are covered in a thick, layered carapace that gives them a distinctive shape. The skin surrounding this carapace
can be a pale blue-gray or brown color mottled with muted yellow spots. Their hands each have three fingers, and their
feet each have two widely-spaced toes. Prothean blood is red.

**Homeworld:** None

**Biotics:** Yes

**Example Names:** Javik

The Citadel was the Prothean seat of government, and the heart of their galaxy-wide empire. Although the Protheans were
a single race, as they expanded and assimilated other spacefaring races into their empire, those servant races adopted
the name "Prothean" for themselves as well. This assimilation was not always peaceful, as advanced species who attempted
to deny or oppose their admittance into the empire were forcibly conquered and assimilated into Prothean society. The
Protheans justified this cultural reconditioning by claiming that if the races who opposed them were actually stronger
than the Protheans, then they would take the Protheans' place as the galaxy's dominant civilization. It was in keeping
with their belief that evolution, or the 'Cosmic Imperative' as they termed it, was the driving force in the universe
and that the strong must flourish by dominating the weak for the greater good of all. This ideology was also dictated by
necessity. After the Protheans encountered hostile machine intelligences, they ultimately decided that all organic races
should join together for the sake of survival. Efforts to smoothly integrate newly-inducted servant races into the
empire were made, like Prothean language tutorial programs. Early Prothean architecture tended to be functional yet
decorative, with eras of their history organized into dynasties producing distinctions of their own, though the designs
tended to become simpler at the time of their extinction. Archaeologists always wondered about the reason, and one of
the theories is that the Protheans were too busy fighting the Reapers to care about aesthetics. The beacons and the
Eletania ruins suggest that, like the Asari, the Protheans were comfortable with the notion of transferring data to an
individual's mind. They invested heavily in their scientific research, a policy that eventually paid off, if too late to
save their own species. Prothean society was heavily regulated; playing games of chance was an offense punishable by
death. Staring contests were a common pastime, made all the more challenging due to the Protheans' four eyes. Females
would also use these eyes to begin foreplay. The Protheans did not "date" species considered primitive in their time,
though they did regard some primitive species, such as quarians, as attractive. Mating between species was considered a
pointless exercise. They were conquered and enslaved much like the others under the empire, and sometimes they were
eaten as well. Asari, however, are apparently exempt from Prothean mating restrictions. Protheans had few compunctions
with eating sentient species, apparently regardless of chemical makeup. Dextro-amino-acid-based races like primitive
Turians and Quarians were just as likely to be made ingredients in Prothean cuisines as primitive Humans, Asari, Hanar,
Salarians, or even Krogan. Hanar were either boiled or fried, and Salarian liver was considered a delicacy.
