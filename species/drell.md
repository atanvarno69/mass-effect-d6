## Species Characteristics

**Martial Experts:** At character creation for every 1 skill point spent in *brawling*, gain 2 instead (maximum of 6).

Gain +3 to *Brawling defense*.

**Technical Weakness:** Advancing *Technical* skills costs twice as many skill points.

**True Believers:** Drell do not require a biotic amp to control their biotic talents, but they may use them.

**Dark Vision:** Drell ignore negative modifiers from darkness but are partially colorblind.

**Dry Homeworld:** Drell do not tolerate high humidity. If the humidity on a planet is higher than 75% and a Drell is
not wearing an environment suit or armor, they incur âˆ’2D to all checks.

**Perfect Memory:** The Drell possess perfect memory not only photographic but also smells and sounds. In order to
"remember" they go in a kind of trance. For a Drell to come out of that trance, they must succeed a moderate *willpower*
check.

## Background

**Physical Appearance:** Drell appearance is very similar to Asari and Humans, but their muscle tissue is slightly
denser than that of Humans, giving them a wiry strength. Many of their more reptilian features are concealed, however
one unique characteristic is the hyoid bone in their throats, which allows them to inflate their throats and produce
vocal sounds outside of the human range.

**Homeworld:** Kahje (actual homeworld Rakhana)

**Religion:** Most Drell are deeply religious, believing that they have souls separate from their bodies. They see death
as a departure from the body, and they also state that a person's body and soul form a whole. When the soul is
traumatized or otherwise disrupted, or the body is ill or injured, a person is no longer Whole. They also believe that
their body can be directed as a separate entity from themselves, in the case of Thane Krios taking no responsibility for
his numerous killings, which were ordered by the hanar. The Drell religion is also polytheistic, with the Drell having
multiple gods whom they pray to in varying situations. This religion included at least three gods: Amonkira, Lord of
Hunters; Arashu, Goddess of Motherhood and Protection; and Kalahira, Goddess of Oceans and Afterlife.

**Biotics:** It is unknown how widespread Drell biotics are, but Drell show a great talent for it

**Example Names:** Thane Krios, Feron, Ilikah, Kolyat, Quoyle

Drell are omnivorous reptile-like humanoids with an average lifespan of 85 galactic standard years. Because the Drell
ancestors emerged from arid, rocky deserts, the humid, ocean-covered Hanar homeworld of Kahje proved tolerable only when
the Drell stayed inside a climate-controlled dome city. The leading cause of death for Drell on Kahje is Kepral's
Syndrome, caused by cumulative long-term exposure to a humid climate. This syndrome erodes the ability of Drell lungs to
take in oxygen, and eventually spreads out to other organs. It is noncommunicable, and there is currently no known cure,
though leading hanar scientific authorities are working on creating a genetic adaptation.

The Drell possess eidetic memory, an adaptation to a world where they must remember the location of every necessary
resource (vegetation, drinkable water and prey migration paths) across vast distances. The memories are so strong that
an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall. These recalls are so vivid and detailed that some Drell may
mistake it for reality. Thane Krios, for example, remembers every assassination he has ever performed and can describe
them in flawless detail, and says he prefers to spend a lonely night with the perfect memory of another. This process
can be involuntary.

The Drell ancestors emerged from dry, rocky deserts on the barren world of Rakhana. Eight centuries ago, the
already-arid Drell homeworld began its swift descent into lifelessness due to disastrous industrial expansion. At the
time, the Drell lacked interstellar flight capacity, and with their population bursting at 11 billion they faced certain
doom. It was around two centuries ago that the Hanar made first contact with the Drell race. In the following ten years,
the Hanar would transport a total of 375,000 Drell to the Hanar homeworld, Kahje. The remaining billions left on Rakhana
would perish on their dying planet, warring against each other for diminishing resources. The Drell now thrive
co-existing with the Hanar and have been a part of the galactic civilization for roughly two centuries. The debt of
gratitude that the Drell owe the Hanar is referred to as the Compact, which the Drell fulfill by taking on tasks that
the Hanar find difficult, such as combat. Any Drell may refuse to serve, but as being requested to serve is a great
honor, few turn down the offer.

Most Drell are content to live on Kahje. They are afforded every opportunity to thrive by the Hanar, yet some outsiders
and even some Hanar regard the Drell as second class citizens. However it is quite the opposite, they have integrated
themselves into every level of Hanar society as respected, productive citizens.

Those who leave Kahje tend to be adventurers. These solitary Drell travelers often seek out new species elsewhere, and
in turn adopt that species' culture. Such Drell number in the thousands, and are scattered across the galaxy, tending
towards quiet, integrated lives. Some Drell grow a close, personal relationship with the Hanar. So much so that the
Hanar will even tell the Drell their "Soul Name". Drell have adapted to communication with Hanar by getting implants in
their eyes to allow them to observe the bioluminescense the Hanar use for communication. Drell such as Thane are able to
see ultraviolet light as a silvery color, though might lose differentiation between colors at the opposite end of the
spectrum, such as the difference between dark red and black.
