## Species Characteristics

**Spacers:** At character creation gain 3 skill points in *starship piloting*.

**Technical Aptitude:** At character creation for every 1 skill point spent in *Technical* skills, gain 2 instead
(maximum of +6).

**Technical Scholars:** At character creation, Quarians may take 2 additional *Technical* skills.

**Technical Society:** Quarians can use Technical Talents without an Omni-Tool, but incur a −6 penalty (other races
cannot use Technical Talents without an Omni-Tool).

**Rig Masters:** Quarians incur a −1D to all *Technical* repair skills when not using an Omni-Tool (other races incur a
−2D).

**Facemask & Envirosuit:** Quarians have virtually no natural immune system. Without a protective suit or sterile
environment, a Quarian is subject to disease. The first time the Quarian is exposed, and once every hour thereafter,
make an attack roll (4D) against the character's Stamina. If the attack succeeds, the character takes 2D points of
damage and moves. This attack occurs again each day the disease remains untreated. Treating the disease requires a
successful moderate *medicine* check. A basic replacement suit costs 2,000 credits (500 on a Quarian vessel), and a
year's supply of filters costs 200 credits (50 on a Quarian vessel). Quarian characters begin play with these items at
no cost.

**Geth Hatred:** Any Quarian character that goes out of their way to destroy or capture a Geth should be given 1
character point (at GM decision). Geth and Quarians can't be in the same party.

**Pilgrimage:** Quarians cannot return to the Migrant Fleet until they have obtained something of value, typically an
artifact, equipment or even some piece of knowledge.

## Background

**Personality:** Quarians are creative and inquisitive, but tend to be defensive as they are well aware of how other
species view them.

**Physical Description:** Quarians are generally shorter and of slighter build than humans. Quarian hands consist of a
thumb and only two fingers, while their feet have only two large, prominent toes. They dress in a scavenged assortment
of materials, hiding their faces behind visors, goggles, or breathing masks. Some believe the Quarians are cybernetic, a
blend of machine and biology that can survive for a time in the cold vacuum of space. Others believe the Quarians are
simply so used to living on their substandard, makeshift ships that they never remove their survival suits.

**Homeworld:** Having no natural world to call home the Quarians wander the galaxy in a flotilla of salvaged ships,
secondhand vessels, and recycled technology.

**Religion:** The Quarians used to practice a form of ancestor worship. This involved taking a personality imprint from
the individual and developing it into an interface similar to a VI. However, the Geth destroyed the Quarians' ancestor
databanks when they rebelled. Respect for their ancestors is still prevalent in Quarian society.

**Example Names:** Tali'Zorah nar Rayya; First name + *nar* (child of) or *vas* (crew of) + name of the ship. Immature
Quarians are still *nar* and are identified as a child of the colony or ship. Once a Quarian has completed their rite of
passage and earned their place on a home-ship they use *vas* instead of *nar*.

The Quarians are a nomadic species of humanoid aliens known for their skills with technology and synthetic
intelligence. Since their home world was conquered, the Quarians live aboard the Migrant Fleet, a huge collection of
starships that travel as a single fleet. Approximately three hundred years ago the Quarians created the Geth, a species
of rudimentary artificial intelligences, to serve as an efficient source of manual labor. However, the Geth gradually
became sentient, rebelled against their Quarian masters and drove them into exile. Now the Quarians wander the galaxy in
a flotilla of salvaged ships, secondhand vessels, and recycled technology.

One of the factors of life aboard the Migrant Fleet is population control. It is illegal for quarian families to have
more than two children to maintain zero population growth -- unless the restriction has been lifted to keep numbers
stable -- so families tend to be small. Along with the fact each Quarian relies on the others for survival, this means
the bonds between Quarians tend to be very strong, compared to a more individualistic race like the Krogan. Loyalty,
trust and cooperation between Quarians are essential for the survival of their species. Quarians enjoy storytelling, and
hold dancers in high esteem. Some ships from the Fleet linger in orbit over planets used as drive discharge sites, to
sell refreshments, supplies or trinkets made by their children to passing crews. Young Quarians place low value on
personal possessions, evaluating objects by their usefulness, and often barter items that are not being used to the rest
of the crew via their ship's trading deck. Even when at home, Quarians wear their environmental suits at all times,
partly out of caution and partly as a psychological reaction to the lack of personal space. Because their suits make it
harder to identify individuals, Quarians have developed the habit of exchanging names whenever they meet. Their
technology and relations to synthetic life have had a profound effect on Quarian culture. As a result, in contrast to
other races, Quarians are reluctant to trust virtually -- or artificially -- intelligent machines, but they are also far
more likely to treat them as if they were living beings
