## Species Characteristics

**Persuasive:** At character creation for every 1 skill point spent in *persuasion*, gain 2 instead (maximum of 6).

**Biotic Aptitude:** Asari do not require a biotic amp to control their biotic talents, but they may use them.

**Biotcic Scholar:** At character creation get 2 biotic talents per 1D *Biotic* attribute.

**Joining:** Asari have the ability to entwine their nervous system and minds with a partner. While this occurs, the two
share sensations and thoughts.

Succeeding a Difficult *willpower* check allows the Asari to relive their joined partner's most recent memories.

Joining can also be used against an unwilling target to implant instructions. This is a vile and vicious act. If used
too often it will incur the full wrath of the Asari people and Council law enforcement.

Using this ability against an unwilling target costs 3 Character Points and may incur Renegade Points.

With an opposed *willpower* check versus the target's *willpower* the Asari can implant instructions as follows:

* Failure or success â‰¤ 16: no effect
* Success > 16: simple instruction
* Success > 26: complex instruction
* Success > 36: permanent instruction

## Background

**Personality:** Asari can live to be over 1,000 years and have three stages to their life: Maiden, Matron, and
Matriarch. In the Maiden stage, Asari seek to go out and learn as much about the galaxy as they can. Military service is
also common in this stage. In the Matron stage, Asari seek to mate with interesting partners in order to have daughters
of their own. The Matriarch stage grants an Asari great power and influence over other Asari as they will defer to the
wisdom of the Matriarchs in times of crisis.

**Physical Description:** Typical Asari individual has a blue to purple complexion; the gas giant Sharblu was named
after a famous Asari soprano with a distinctive skin tone that resembled the planet's atmosphere. Some Asari can also
have a teal complexion, but this seems to be a rarity. Some Asari have facial markings, which are unique color patterns
that vary for every Asari. Some of these facial markings are associated with eyebrows by humans, but the Asari do not
think of the markings as such themselves. In the place of head hair, Asari possess semi-flexible, cartilage based scalp
crests that grow into shape. These structures are rigid, and do not "flop around" as some believe.

**Homeworld:** Thessia

**Religion:** Siari

**Biotics:** Many Asari are naturally biotic to some degree

**Example Names:** Liara T'Soni, Mallene Calis, Nassana, Benezia, Sha'ira

The Asari are native to the planet Thessia. They are often considered the most powerful and respected sentient species
in the known galaxy. This is partly due to the fact the Asari were the first race after the Protheans to achieve
interstellar flight, and to discover and inhabit the Citadel. An all-female race (however, see below), the Asari are
known for their elegance, diplomacy, and biotic talent. Their millennia-long lifespan and unique physiology -- allowing
them to reproduce with a partner of any gender or species -- give them a conservative but convivial attitude toward other
races. The Asari were instrumental in proposing and founding the Citadel Council, and have been at the heart of galactic
society ever since. Because of their long lifespan, Asari tend to have a 'long view' not common in other races. When
they encounter a new species or situation, the Asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation
and study than immediate action. They are unfazed that some of their investments or decisions may not pay off for
decades or centuries. Matriarchs can seem to make incomprehensible decisions, but their insight is evident when their
carefully-laid plans come to fruition. In interstellar relations, this long view manifests in the unspoken policy of
centrism. The Asari instinctively seek to maintain stable balances of economic, political, and military power.
Traditionally, Asari spread their influence through cultural domination and intellectual superiority. They invite new
species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will inevitably
influence the existing culture. The Asari tend toward communal, consensus attitudes among themselves too: for example,
they prefer to live in shared spaces aboard starships even if there are alternatives available. Asari believe that their
offspring acquire the best qualities of the 'father' from the melded genes, but evidence is anecdotal. They frown upon
interspecies conception, believing that, as genetic traits and cultural insight can be gained from mating outside their
species, it is wasteful for Asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as
'purebloods', which is a great insult among the Asari. It is unknown if this is merely a social convention, or if the
added genetic diversity is truly advantageous. Clearly the Asari were quite successful when they had no other species to
mate with, and returning to the old way does not seem to result in 'inferior' offspring. The Asari governmental
structure, known as the Asari Republics, is relatively broad; the Asari came late to the notion of world government. For
centuries, their homeworld of Thessia was dotted with loose confederacies of great republican cities. The closest Earth
equivalent would be the ancient Mediterranean city-states. Since the Asari culture values consensus and accommodation,
there was little impetus to form larger principalities. Rather than hoard resources, the Asari bartered freely. Rather
than attack one another over differing philosophies, they sought to understand one another. Only in the information age
did the city-states grow close; communication over the internet evolved into an 'electronic democracy'.
