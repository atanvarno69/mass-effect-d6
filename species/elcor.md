## Background

**Personality:** Elcor are deliberate and conservative

**Physical Description:** Elcor evolved on a high-gravity world, making them slow, but incredibly strong. Their large,
heavy bodies are incapable of moving quickly, but they possess a rather imposing stature and immense strength, as well
as thick, tough skin. They move using all four limbs to support and balance their massive bodies. Given their method of
communication, they likely have highly-attuned olfactory senses.

**Homeworld:** Dekuuna

**Religion:**

**Biotics:** No mention of the biotic abilities

**Example Names:** Calyn, Petozi, Xeltan

The Elcor are a Citadel species native to the high-gravity world Dekuuna. They are massive creatures, standing on four
muscular legs for increased stability. Elcor move slowly, an evolved response to an environment where a fall can be
lethal. Elcor speech is heard by most species as a flat, ponderous monotone. Among themselves, scent, extremely slight
body movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning that make a human smile seem as subtle as a
fireworks display. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, the Elcor often go out of
their way to clarify when they are being sarcastic, amused, or angry. Elcor evolved on a high-gravity world, making them
slow, but incredibly strong. Their large, heavy bodies are incapable of moving quickly, but they possess a rather
imposing stature and immense strength, as well as thick, tough skin. They move using all four limbs to support and
balance their massive bodies. Given their method of communication, they likely have highly-attuned olfactory senses and
sophisticated scent glands. Like Earth's dinosaurs, prehistoric Elcor travelled across Dekuuna in large tribal groups.
These groups were likely led by the oldest and most experienced Elcor. This may have later developed into the Elcor
culture of Elders, whose wisdom could keep the tribe safe provided they followed the correct guidance. According to
their ambassador, the Elcor were just making their first forays into space travel when the asari made contact with them.
With their help, the Elcor discovered the closest mass relay and, within a single lifetime, had established a regular
trade route to the Citadel. The Elcor quickly became one of the more prominent species in Citadel space, though they
still have to share an embassy with the volus. Elcor usually prefer to stay on their colonies rather than travel in
space, which may be why few Elcor are seen on the Citadel or on other worlds. Possibly because of their size or
evolution in the open air, the Elcor find the necessary confines of space travel uncomfortable. Evolving in a
high-gravity environment where a fall could be lethal has made Elcor psychology deeply cautious and conservative. Their
culture is built on small, tight-knit groups, and their conservative nature means the Elcor government is extremely
stable. The Elcor follow the recommendations of their Elders, who spend years poring over ancient records of
jurisprudence to determine the precedent that should be followed in any given situation. The Elders record closely
argued and minutely detailed instructions on what course to follow in any theoretical crisis. These are filed away in
huge libraries of data discs and consulted at need. This makes Elcor policies very predictable, provided one has done a
great deal of research. The Elcor economy is small, only slightly larger than the Alliance's, but extremely well
developed. They see no point to rushing things, and are fond of making thorough, century-long development plans. They
don't need to trade for any resource -- they have all they require to supply their own needs, and trade only in finished
goods. Any attempt to embargo their space would be fruitless. Because their slow, conservative psyche is not suitable
for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions necessary in combat situations, the Elcor rely on sophisticated VI combat
systems. These war machines can choose between thousands of gambits developed and polished over centuries by Elcor
strategists. The slow speed and immense size of the Elcor makes them easy targets. Fortunately, their durable hide
allows them to shrug off most incoming fire. Elcor warriors don't carry small arms; their broad shoulders serve as a
stable platform for the same size of weapons typically mounted on Alliance fighting vehicles.
