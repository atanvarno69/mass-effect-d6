## Species Characteristics

**Espionage:** At character creation for every 1 skill point spent in *survival*, *law enforcement*, *investigation*,
*hide*, *sneak*, *search*, *electronic devices*, or *decryption*, gain 2 instead (maximum of +6).

**High Metabolism:** A Salarians may take two actions each turn without incurring the multi action penalty. If more than
two actions are taken in a turn, this characteristic is ignored and the normal multi action penalty is applied.

A Salarians requires one hour of sleep each day. This does not give healing benefits of 8 hours of rest in only one
hour, only mitigates the need for 8 hours of sleep. Natural healing still works as normal.

**Breathe Underwater:** A Salarian can breathe normally underwater and can't drown in water.

**Expert Swimmer:** A Salarian may choose to reroll any Swim check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even
if it is worse. In addition, a Salarian may choose to take 10 on *Swim* checks even when distracted or threatened.

**Low-Light Vision:** A Salarian ignores negative modifiers from darkness up to 25 meters.

## Background

**Personality:** Salarians have a faster than normal metabolism, often appearing jittery. They also possess a keen
intellect, rarely forgetting any fact or figure

**Physical Description:** The Salarians are a bipedal race of amphibians, with tall, elongated bodies well-suited for
their high metabolism, and skeletons composed of more cartilage than those of other races such as humans. Salarian heads
are long and thin, and have a pair of horns protruding from the top of their skulls. Skin varies in color, from bright
reds and greens to the more common shades of blue or grey. Their blood is a greenish color. Salarian eyes are large and
oval and have thin membranes in place of eyelids. The pupils are a wide slit, oriented horizontally, and the irises can
be dark green, purple, or brown. Salarians blink upwards, rather than downwards as Humans do.

**Homeworld:** Sur'Kesh

**Religion:** Salarians are not notably religious, but as free-willed sentients there are exceptions. One of the less
favored Salarian religions worships a goddess, and claims that a certain pattern of overlapping craters in the southern
hemisphere of Trelyn resembles her.

**Biotics:** Salarian biotics are unusual and highly prized

**Example Names:** Kirrahe, Schells, Chorban, Anoleis

The second species to join the Citadel, the Salarians are warm-blooded amphibians native to the planet Sur'Kesh.
Salarians possess a hyperactive metabolism; they think fast, talk fast, and move fast. To Salarians, other species seem
sluggish and dull-witted, especially the Elcor. Unfortunately, their metabolic speed leaves them with a relatively short
lifespan; Salarians over the age of 40 are a rarity.

Salarians are known for their observational capability and non-linear thinking. This manifests as an aptitude for
research and espionage. They are constantly experimenting and inventing, and it is generally accepted that they always
know more than they are letting on. Salarians are noted for their high-speed metabolism, which allows them to function
on just one hour of sleep a day. Their minds and bodies work faster than most sapient races, making them seem restless
or hyperactive. The drawback of this active metabolism is a short lifespan of around 40 human years. The Salarians are
amphibian haplo-diploid egg-layers; unfertilized eggs produce males and fertilized eggs produce females. Once a year, a
Salarian female will lay a clutch of dozens of eggs. Social rules prevent all but a fraction from being fertilized. As a
result, 90% of the species is male.

Salarians have photographic memories and rarely forget a fact. They also possess a form of psychological "imprinting",
tending to defer to those they knew in their youth. salarian hatching is a solemn ritual in which the clan Dalatrass
(matriarch) isolates herself with the eggs. The young Salarians psychologically imprint on her and tend to defer to her
wishes. During the hatching of daughters, the Dalatrasses of the mother and father's clans are present at the
imprinting. This ensures the offspring have equal loyalty to both, ensuring the desired dynastic and political unity.
Salarian sex drive and reproduction differ from that of Humans, it is not hormone-based. Reproduction is more of a
necessity and salarians do not seem to desire sex for pleasure.

Salarians excel at invention, preferring to use cutting-edge technology rather than settle for anything less. For
example, their GARDIAN starship defenses put emphasis on high performance over reliability even though a malfunction
could cost lives. Even Schells rejected a cheating device that used "brute force", spending five years to refine it into
a more sophisticated, undetectable system. The Salarians see information gathering and even spying as a matter of course
when dealing with other races, but this is not underhanded: they simply embrace the dictum of "knowledge is power".
Alliance counterintelligence agencies are constantly uncovering salarian agents and cyber-warfare incursions, but there
is little they can do to stop them. As a Salarian information broker once told David Anderson, "Your species has been
transmitting data across the extranet for less than a decade. My species has been directing the primary espionage and
intelligence operations for the Council for two thousand years."

Normally, the rare salarian females are cloistered on their worlds out of tradition and respect. Powerful female
Dalatrasses are dynasts and political kingpins. They determine the political course of their respective regions through
shrewd negotiation.
