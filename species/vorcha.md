The Vorcha are the shortest-lived sapient species currently known, with an average lifespan of only 20 years.

The Vorcha originate from Heshtok, a small, hostile, overcrowded planet which has been largely stripped of natural
resources by successive generations of this fast-breeding, savage species. The lack of resources has resulted in a
tight-knit, clan-based society in which rival clans wage constant war against one another for control of scarce
resources. Even as their population grows, the Vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over basic
necessities. This incessant warfare has made each generation of Vorcha stronger and more aggressive than that which
preceded it, but their continual lack of resources has kept Vorcha society extremely primitive.

Vorcha society is built around combat. In fact, the Vorcha use combat, both individually and in groups, as their default
form of communication resulting in their communications being primarily non-verbal. The Vorcha are a clan based people
who prefer living in communal environments with others of their species to living alone or in the company of alien
races. When a clan population grows too large, younger members will depart to start a new clan elsewhere. The Vorcha are
extremely aggressive, both against rivals of their own species and against any alien who stands in their way. Vorcha who
have managed to escape their homeworld have a tendency to occupy uninhabited areas of space stations or larger
spaceships.

The Vorcha are not themselves a space-faring race, although many have found their way off-world as stowaways on ships
visiting their homeworld. The Vorcha who escaped their hostile homeworld did so by hiding on the ships of space-faring
races that had the misfortune of visiting their planet. Their adaptability and resilience allows them to flourish in the
dark and dirty corners of the places they end up.
