## Species Characteristics

**Synthetic:** Geth are immune to poisons and gases.

Geth do not eat, drink or sleep and can survive in vacuum.

Geth can be modified in the same way you would implant new cybernetics. Geth have a limit of 45 upgrade points and mod
slots by installing cybernetic implants and armor mods. 1 upgrade points is equal to 1 mod slot when installing
additional mods. Geth can’t modify themselves.

**Technology Aptitude:** At character creation for every 1 skill point spent in the following skills gain 2 instead
(maximum of 6).

* *electronic devices*
* *search*
* *security*
* *synthetics*

**Armor Plated:** Geth can’t wear any additional armor.

Gain +4 additional *Damage resistance*.

**Internal Kinetic Barriers:** Geth have 6 points of Kinetic Barriers.

**Shield Boost:** Geth regenerate full Kinetic Barriers every 2 rounds when not receiving damage.

**Ambiguous Morality:** Due to their lack of morality Geth can't use Paragon or Renegade points.

**Shunned:** Due to devastation that the Geth brought to the galaxy's inhabitants. All *bargain*, *con*, *command*,
*persuasion* and *streetwise* tests attempted by Geth are raised by 2 difficulty levels.

The GM may also decide that such a test can't be even attempted.

**Singular Unit:** PCs playing as Geth are individual units that are disconnected form the Geth network or are drones
sent by the Geth collective to gather data. Either way the GM and the PC should adjust accordingly.

## Background

**Personality:** See below

**Physical Description:** Physically, the humanoid geth resemble Quarians -- their hands, head shape and legs are
similar -- which is probably a holdover from their origins. A common design feature among geth is a single brightly
glowing photoreceptor, causing some to refer to them as "flashlight heads". Geth are primarily composed of two
materials: a flexible but durable outer shell, and a kind of synthetic muscle tissue. It is actually possible for this
synthetic muscle to be grafted to organic. Geth "bleed" a white conductive fluid when shot, but they don't have any
internal organs or nervous system, so the geth do not feel hunger or pain. The Geth are also seen using omni-tools, and
have seemingly modified them to heal synthetic wounds; likewise, some Geth facilities contain first-aid kits, implying
that their synthetic "tissues" can be repaired using conventional medical technology.

**Homeworld:** Beyond Perseus Veil

**Religion:** None

**Biotics:** No

**Example Names:** Legion

The Geth are reclusive and secretive. This is partly due to their synthetic nature: They have no need to interact with
other races because they do not share the same goals, needs or instincts as organic species. As machines, comfort is
also not a concern for them, something that is reflected in elements of Geth ship and station design. They find it more
efficient to live on space stations and draw resources from asteroids.

Geth psychology is completely alien to organics. They do not value individuality, preferring to share all memories and
thoughts of all programs. This means Geth cannot and do not wish to hide their thoughts, even those that do not follow
the norm, with their reasoning for differing thoughts being apparent. More importantly, deceit, manipulation and lying
are impossible among the Geth. No concepts of vulnerability or privacy exist; Geth are completely honest with each other
about their thoughts and their reasons for those thoughts. This means there is a great deal of understanding amongst
Geth, with every Geth being part of the consciousness of every other Geth. While the Geth are incapable of deceit
amongst themselves, they are not above using deceit to study organic behavior. Geth have no government or leaders; the
Geth use FTL communications to "build a consensus", a completely Consensus Democratic method in which every Geth program
makes a choice on any matter. Even within Legion itself, consensus must be reached among its many programs before
decisions can be made.
