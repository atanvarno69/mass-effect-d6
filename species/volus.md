## Species Characteristics

**Financial Aptitude:** At character creation for every 1 skill point spent in the following skills gain 2 instead
(maximum of +6).

* *alien species*
* *bargain*
* *bureaucracy & business*
* *con*
* *forgery*
* *gambling*
* *persuasion*
* *value*

**Small Statue:** Volus gain +1D+1 to *sneak* checks.

**Low-Light Vision:** Ignore negative modifiers from darkness up to 20 meters.

**Pressure Suits:** Volus have pressure suits which protect them from all environmental dangers such as lack of air,
pressure. Volus suffer from limitations outside their native atmosphere. Without their special atmospheric suits, a
Volus is considered blind, begins to suffocate and takes 3D damage each round. A replacement suit costs 2,000 credits
(1,000 in volus Space or on the Citadel). Volus characters begin play with these items at no cost. The ammonia tank is
poisonous to other species and the increased gravity makes them suffer as if in a high-gravity environment.

## Background

**Personality:** What they lack in personal bravery, they more than make up for with their cunning and tenacity, often
using their expert negotiating skills to get them out of scrapes

**Physical Description:** Their home planet's gravity is 1.5 times that of Earth's, with a high-pressure ammonia-based
atmosphere, making their bodies short and almost spherical, and requiring them to wear protective suits in order to
function in environments conducive to other species

**Homeworld:** Irune

**Religion:** Good Business!

**Biotics:** No mention of the biotic abilities

**Example Names:** Doran, Jahleed, Barla Von

The Volus are an associate race on the Citadel with their own embassy, but are also a client race of the Turians. They
hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support an ammonia-based biochemistry. As
a result, the Volus must wear pressure suits and breathers when dealing with other species. Because they are not
physically adept compared to most species, Volus mostly make their influence felt through trade and commerce, and they
have a long history on the Citadel. However, they have never been invited to join the Council, which is a sore point for
many Volus individuals. The Volus home world Irune features an ammonia-based ecology and a gravitational field 1.5 times
that of Earth, as well as a high pressure atmosphere. This is reflected in the physiology of the Volus themselves. The
Volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to Humans and other carbon-based life forms, and
as such require protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere, as well as being pressurized to support the
Volus. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to
most species, their flesh will actually split open. Volus culture is dominated by trade, whether it be of land,
resources, or even other tribe members. The Volus have a reputation as traders and merchants, and many, such as Barla
Von, work as some of the best financial advisers in Citadel space. Because the Volus are not physically adept, they tend
not to be very violent, and can even seem overly-pacifistic and cowardly to other, more militant species. Their
inability to provide adequate soldiers for themselves and the Citadel is a primary reason for not yet being inducted
into the Council. Volus have two names but no family names. According to Volus sensibilities you cannot own a person, so
using a family name would essentially be laying claim to their offspring. Possibly because of their tribal origins,
Volus tend to refer to members of other races by their source world rather than species name (i.e. 'Earth-clan' instead
of 'Human'). The Volus government is known as the Vol Protectorate. Rather than being a fully sovereign government in
its own right, the Protectorate is a client state of the Turian Hierarchy. In return for falling under the protective
umbrella of the Turian military, the Volus pay a tax to the Hierarchy, as well as deferring to the Turians in all
foreign policy matters and providing auxiliary troops to the Turian armed forces. They still maintain an embassy on the
Citadel, making them an associate species of the Council, though they currently share their embassy with the Elcor. The
Volus are not physically cut out for combat, be it a full-scale war or even a bar room scuffle. As such, they are highly
dependent on the Turians for defense, although the Volus themselves do provide some auxiliary troops to the Hierarchy.
The Volus will support the Turians in any war they might pursue, and the Turians will support the Volus in any war they
might pursue. Possibly for this reason, Volus weaponry tends to be utilitarian rather than high-grade. Some Volus
manufacturers specialize in cheaper, lower-grade copies of expensive Turian equipment.
